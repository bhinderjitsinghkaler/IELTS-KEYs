                In some countries the media is controlled exclusively by large companies; in other it is the government that has this control. Often, in war situation, one of the first casualties is the media, which is seized by one group or another. This gives some support to the idea that the media is a source of power and control.
                <br>
                <br>
                Whoever controls the media also has ultimate control over what is published or broadcasted and what is omitted. They can also add a certain prejudice or bias to their coverage of certain news stories depending on their own feelings about the matter. This is not a new problem, although the issue is perhaps more pressing now that the Internet and play-TV have enabled these messages to be disseminated even further.
                <br>
                <br>
                However, we should remember that readers have their own ideas and opinions. You can control what is printed but you cannot control the opinions of your readers. I think the only positive here is that, nowadays, people seem to be much more cynical about what they read in the press or hear on the television. In particular, when it comes to the tabloid press, people know that they have to take what they read with a grain of salt. In other words, they read knowing they may be being lied to. Perhaps it is even greater concern that we have become so accepting of this form of censorship.
                <br>
                <br>
                The only thing that can be done to alter this situation is for the government to regulate the industry so that there is no longer a monopoly on media ownership. This also means that they have to allow and support a totally free press, even if this means the government may be criticised or ridiculed within its pages.

                As a result of constant media attention, sports professionals in my country have become stars and celebrities, and those at the top are paid huge salaries. Just like movie stars, they live extravagant lifestyles with huge houses and cars.
                <br>
                <br> 
                Many people find their rewards unfair, especially when comparing these super salaries with those of top surgeons or research scientists, or even leading politicians who have the responsibility of governing the country. However, sports salaries are not determined by considering the contribution to society a person makes, or the level of responsibility he or she holds. Instead, they reflect the public popularity of sport in general and level of public support that successful stars can generate. So the notion of ‘fairness’ is not issue.
                <br>
                <br>
                Those who feel that sports stars’ salaries are justified might argue that the number of professionals with real talent are very few, and the money is recognition of the skills and dedication a person need to be successful. Competition is constant and player is tested every time they perform in their relatively short career. The pressure from the media is intense and there is little privacy out of the spotlight. So all of these factors may justify the huge earnings.
                <br>
                <br>
                Personally, I think that the amount of money such sports stars make is more justified than the huge earnings of movie stars, but at the same time, it indicates that our society places more value on sport than more essential professions and achievements.

                Smoking is an expensive habit which pollutes the environment and carries serious health risk, yet a third of the men in the world smoke. It is also a sad fact that one in five teenagers take up the habit when they are as young as 11. Of course, there is one interest group, the tobacco industry, which is more than happy with this situation, since its profits depend on our addiction to cigarettes.
                <br>
                <br>
                These statistics are particularly depressing because the link between smoking and cancer, heart disease and other serious illnesses has been known for many years. We must also remember that apart from harming the individual, smoking represents a huge cost to society. The money we spend on treating smoking-related disease could be used for much better purposes, such as helping to feed the world’s poor or paying for medical research.
                <br>
                <br>
                So why, despite all the evidence, do people still smoke? The obvious answer is that cigarettes are highly addictive, so that it can be extremely difficult to give up. Another answer is the power of peer pressure, especially amongst young people. In my view, the most important thing is to discourage people from starting to smoke, and we could do this be increasing the tax on tobacco and banning cigarette advertising. I also feel that people who want to quit should be given as much advice and support as possible.
                <br>
                <br>
                In conclusion, I believe that we should do everything we can to reduce the number of smokers in society. However, it is not enough to provide information about health risks, we also need to use a variety of strategies to tackle the problem.

                Nowadays most children regularly play games on a computer or their television. These games have become more violent over the past few years. In fact, many parents worry about this and the effect these games are having on their children. Some are concerned that playing violent games might encourage them to come aggressive in real life. What we need to establish is whether or not this is actually true.
                <br>
                <br>
                First, it may help to look back at the games that children used to play many years ago before the invention of computers. In those days children would probably have played popular board games such as Monopoly or Chess, or they may have played card games or some type of outdoor sport. These sports or games would probably only have encouraged children to become more competitive rather than violent.
                <br>
                <br>
                However, throughout history children have always played fighting games with toy or pretend weapons. Even now many parents will buy a toy gun or sword for their child. Why do we never read reports in the media about the impact plastic weapons could have on children? Perhaps this is because the link between play fighting and actual fighting is not very strong.
                <br>
                <br>
                In conclusion, the way children play games has changed with the times but the ideas behind those games have actually changed very little. Just as playing at soldiers did not increase violence in the past, I believe that playing computer games will not lead to an increase in violence in the future. I think that if we looked more closely at life in our major cities then we would find there are many other possible causes for the increase in crime and violence.

                The birth rate in most developed countries is predicted to begin to fall over the next 50 years. By 2030 it is estimated that over one third of the population in most developed countries will be aged 65 and over. What effects will these predictions have on developed countries if they prove true? What can be done now to deal with this situation?
                <br>
                <br>
                In modern Europe the problem of birth rates has become very actual. As a result, many issues will arise, and the present generation of people will see a significant number of changes. It is important to outline some notable aspects of this question, such as the rise in the number of new migrants, and the ruin of pension system, which can be compensated only by a decrease of pensions.
                <br>
                <br>
                First of all, the population of every country is a working force and the lack of it creates many problems for the economy. At the same time, there are several solutions to this problem which are appropriate in the world. For example, to attract people from developing countries to reside in Europe with an aim to filling the gap. Unfortunately, it is predictable that this tendency can make worse the relations on the cultural base, and this the reason why certain parts of society do not accept this idea.
                <br>
                <br>
                Secondly, the stability of the pension system depends on one vital factor – the number of people who work and pay their taxes. The decline of population always leads to a reduction of budget revenue, and an economy in state spending. In this case, the government is obligated to make some unpopular decisions, for instance, to reduce pensions. This solution is regarded as negative, however, it is the most suitable answer in this situation.
                <br>
                <br>
                In conclusion, it is important to make a remark here; that the decline of population is a very negative trend which can bring some bad consequences, such as the problem with the work force, or the crisis of the pension system. However, there are some unpleasant solutions to this problems, the reduction of pensions, and changes in migration policy with the target of attracting new employees from foreign countries.

                In the past, it was a custom for fathers to be the only back bone of the family. Fathers would go out to work and earn money to fulfill the families’ daily needs and mothers would stay home to take care of the children. However, nowadays, it is not rare to find both parents going out to work. Whilst the additional income might bring benefits to everyone especially the children, there are a number of drawbacks that cannot be overlooked. This essay will confer whether or not it is necessary for both parents to go out to earn money for a living.
                <br>
                <br>
                In some families, both parents are required to work not because of their own will, but because circumstances demand them to. As living cost and everything is getting more expensive in today’s competitive world, some families might not earn enough to cover their living cost if only one parent goes out to work. That being the case, there is nothing anyone can do to help. However, the benefit of the extra income for the children still remains unchanged. With more income, parents will be able to afford more new toys, the latest gadget, and even vacation abroad.
                <br>
                <br>
                On the other hand, children might feel abandoned due to their parents’ never being there for them. It is also proven that children’s, whose parents are never at home, are more prone to behavioral problems. For instance, my friend, Elaine, whose parents is always working overnight and is never there for her when she needs them, has to battle with her insecurity of being unwanted every day, she in turn tries to seek the attention of her teachers by behaving badly in the class. From my example, you can see how parents’ absence can affect children in the long run.
                <br>
                <br>
                As far as I am concerned, there is no need for both parents to be working unless it is really necessary. While additional income is benefiting for the children, the presence of a mother will be best for the children’s well-being in the long run.

              Males and females are often viewed as having differing skill sets. It is agreed that it is correct to exclude people from certain jobs on the basis of their gender, but only in very limited circumstances. This essay will first discuss how physical attributes prevent women from excelling in particular roles; secondly discuss how society at large rejects men from undertaking certain careers, followed by a reasoned conclusion.
              <br>
              <br>
              For many years the general consensus in the armed forces is that women should not be allowed to participate in combat missions. This is because most women lack the brute strength required for this particular occupation and it is therefore right to prevent them from joining the ranks. For example, the American Army recently allowed some women to fight on the front line and the Department of Defence deemed the experiment a failure, due to lack of fighting effectiveness. Despite this, many women have fought in many wars, famously on the Eastern Front for Russia and the Viet Cong in Vietnam, so maybe it is men’s’ attitudes that prevent them performing rather than their stature.
              <br>
              <br>
              Society has yet to accept men in many traditionally female positions, such as nanny or beautician. Businesses feel that it is fine to not hire men for these posts because most of their customers would not be willing to have a man perform that service. I personally know of one example when a friend failed at the interview stage when applying to become kindergarten teacher because he was the wrong sex.
              <br>
              <br>
              To summarise, in limited circumstances it is just to prohibit people from certain occupations, but only if they cannot physically perform or if the general consensus is that it is a single sex post.

              In recent years, great attention has been paid to the topic of who should be the most responsible for the child’s behavior. Therefore, there is numerous discussions on this issue. Some people state that parents and teachers ought to be blamed for crimes committed by young children. However, some opponents disagree with the above perspective. In this essay, the argument will be carefully examined to support my opinion.
              <br>
              <br>
              The first thing to consider is the fact that children’s surroundings drastically affect their growths. According to the recent report in Japan, about 80 percent of young children responded TV games or computer games were the most inspiring for them to make crimes. Thanks to advanced technology, young children can play violent games with extremely clear screens. This has drastically encouraged for children’s violent behaviors in real world. In addition, advanced technology didn’t give us only these harmful game, but also social network service so that people can be connected easily with even strangers. If young children meet bad people on website and are unfortunately related with them, young children might be involved in violent crimes. Therefore, I would like to argue that it is insufficient to conclude that teachers and parents should be responsible for children’s behaviors.
              <br>
              <br>
              On the other hand, it is also true that teachers and parents are close to their children. Children have many things which they don’t know what they must not do and what they may do. Teachers and parents usually have many chances to meet their children and teach these things. However, the time children’s teachers and parents is limited. It is impossible to accompany with their children. Besides of this, children can have their own computers or games and it is difficult for their teachers and parents to intervene all the time. Therefore, as I mentioned in the second paragraph, what teachers and parents can do for their children is limited and children can make criminal even if parents or teachers educate them due to other surroundings.
              <br>
              <br>
              In the final analysis, I would like to emphasize that this problem should be discussed by more various perspectives. It is too overlooked to conclude teachers and parents should be responsible for their children’s behaviors. In my opinion, other surroundings such as games play more important roles than teachers and parents when children commit crime.

            The education is the backbone of a country’s future, while a good job is the key factor for a better life. This topic is of particular importance because it affects everyone’s life. This essay will discuss whether the pupils should complete their higher education or to start work after school.
            <br>
            <br>
            On the one hand, university education is mandatory to get some type of jobs. By this I mean that, people who choose to become a doctor, pharmacist, engineer, pilot etc. are required to complete their degrees before they can be able to get a job, because this type of jobs need specialized knowledge before starting the career. For illustrations, General Medical Counsel in the UK accepts only doctors who completed their degree and passed some predefined exams to start career as a doctor. In this instance, obviously, it would be better to complete the required university level degree first.
            <br>
            <br>
            On the other hand, there are some benefits if students start working early. For example, a fashion designer could start working as soon as s/he finishes school because those types of jobs require more experience than study. Moreover, working at early ages might help students to be more independent and responsible in their life, through learning how to control their spending, how to enhance their knowledge and skill.
            <br>
            <br>
            To conclude, there are some types of jobs that require a university degree. Nevertheless, starting work after school has a good side as well. It depends on the type of jobs which students prefer and are likely to have in the future. Perhaps, university degree and work experience are both important and they each other complete the criteria to get a respectable job.

            Today, plenty of medical methods are used by professionals to cure humans. These methods have different impacts via different mechanisms to control the development of each disease. I believe that bonding between patient and doctor is extremely important because it can raise the level of confidence between them, and the patient will receive a more accurate therapy.
            <br>
            <br>
            Apparently, despite using modern medication introduced by developed countries, alternative medicine, hypnotism or other traditional methods have not been forgotten yet. In this way, in China, traditional medicine has been used by many professionals teaching medicine in university, and different methods are applied to cure debilitated humans, like putting needles on different parts of feet to relieve musculoskeletal pains.
            <br>
            <br>
            In addition, doctor-patient communication is a very important factor and positive reinforcement is a leading strategy that many health professionals usually use to enhance the level of reliability of each medical treatment. Clearly, having a better self-confidence, a medical doctor can show his or her abilities to cure diseases and become prosperous in finding the causes of their patients’ problems. In particular, an experienced psychologist can relief the symptoms of a depressed patient better when he is supported mentally by using some hypnotism techniques. His physician can explain the mechanism of this type of medical induction in detail and raise the trustworthy between them.
            <br>
            <br>
            Another factor why a patient should be familiar with the process of his treatment is that he will become more punctual in using of drugs. Definitely, to reach the maximum of influence of each medication, including modern or alternative medicine, people must use prescribed drugs accurately. A perfect healthcare employee must value his or her patients’ opinions and give the detail of procedure as long as ethical issues of therapy are not being missed. For example, a one being diagnosed with a progressed cancer must be informed how much some alternative medicines might be important than chemotherapy, and their oncoming side effects must precisely be explained to the patient. As a result, this patient will be able to select these therapies instead of usage of chemical therapies.
            <br>
            <br>
            In conclusion, reliability is an essential factor for receiving a better healthcare service. From my point of view, knowing about the details of treatment and having mutual relationship between doctor and patient, are the two important reasons that increase the speed of improvement of diseases.

            While “burning the midnight oil” for your final exam, you may find yourself nervously shaking and on the verge of exploding. On this fatal date many of your future hopes can be crushed. Too much strain is put on a single, taking approximately an hour, assessment. This practice has been taken for granted for many years and only recently some voices are raised its old – fashioned.
            <br>
            <br>
            The testing system has one distinctive feature that enhances the process of education. It is universal and standardized while at the same time it does not take into account the individual. Therefore, teachers are relieved from the burden of designing a personal exam paper. However, some scientists argue that each student possesses unique qualities (creativity, imagination, logical thinking) and unified, strict methods of assessment cannot bring them on the surface.
            <br>
            <br>
            Nowadays, ambitious parents push their kids to be more obsessed with marks. There are many cases of people encouraging their children to calculate perplexing equations or studying French. All this at the expense of playing outside, socializing and just being a kid. The reason is obvious – the better the under aged perform, the higher prospects for “hot” schools.
            <br>
            <br>
            Another aspect of the stressful practice in the modern examination is that it shows only the momentary situation. Even though, you may have problems with one part of the textbook, the outcome depends on pure chance. A good step in reversing the process is the ¾ test throughout the semester, implemented nu universities.
            <br>
            <br>
            On balance, the outdated approach to assessment should be reached and adapted to fit in the modern situation. More constructiveness and reducing the anxiety are vital if society wants to keep people willing to learn and not just to achieve high marks.

            Nowadays people are free to make a lot of options related to food. Some of them argue that eating meat or fish have fundamentaly beneficial influence on our planet and own life, while many others contend that it has a detrimentaly effect as well. To my view of thinking, meat and fish are one of most important material for our normal health condition, due to this it is harmful to refuse it absolutely.
            <br>
            <br>
            Firtly, meat and fish provide a lot of useful vitamins. It is extremely necessary for our normal vital processes such us growing or maturing. Lacf of this material causes serious disabilities. Moreover, the amount of fish and animal should be regulated due to the shortage of feed in the water and earth which is needed.
            <br>
            From the other side, the destruction of fish and animal could cause a disappearance of specific species. For instance, there are a lot of special species of fish that are written into a red book but still killing ilegally. This negalive asspect provide harmful acquitances which should be solved globally.
            <br>
            <br>
            In my opinion, people should not refuse it totally because it make negative influence on their health. I convinced that this problem could be solved by smaller quantity of meat and fish. This sollution guarantees a smaller request of these products and positive effect on balance of living organisms on earth.
            <br>
            <br>
            Taking these points into consideration, I would like to say that there some advantages and disadvantages bought by eating meat and fish. However, in my opinion, the supply of this product should be regulated very carefully saving the balance of these organisms, but nobody should refuse this material wholly due to useful materials which are taken.

            Gaining weight especially in young teenagers is a major anxious matter amongst many countries. Children became fat because of the modernization and technology advancement. This essay will discuss for the problems of obesity in young people and the responsibilities for the government, the society and the parents.
            <br>
            <br>
            It is likely that one of the prominent causes giving rises to this problem is the major change in our lifestyle due to remarkable advancement in technology, which has considerable impact on our daily life and health. Children could consume many junk foods at any time, which we consume every day made the matters worse. These foods, which are easily available, often contain ingredients that are highly in calorie, cholesterol and fat, while lack necessary vitamin, mineral and protein and these factors are taking a toll on our health. In addition, teenagers are playing with their computers rather than playing outside. As a result, teenagers are lacking in exercises and becoming overweight.
            <br>
            <br>
            In my opinion, teachers, parents and government as a whole should take this issue as an emergency and take a necessary step. For instance, parents are keep an eye on their children’s eating habit and make sure to take healthy food while reducing the quality of junk food. The government could limit junk food advertising to discourage children to fail for the bad eating habits.
            <br>
            <br>
            In conclusion, although many countries are now falling in the similar issues of unhealthy diet but we can defeat this issue by following the steps such as the limit of the junk food consumed by children.

            Human beings have an unquestionable need to express themselves and their needs through various forms, the most common of which is speech. Therefore, my opinion is that the freedom of speech is of vital importance in order for a society to be called “free”.
            <br>
            <br>
            Freedom of speech brings about numerous benefits which can be put into two aspects. The first one is for a nation. Freedom of speech, provided that it is protected by law, enables the press or a citizen to show the wrongdoings of one or some specific authorities. This gives a chance for careful inquiries to ensure the transparency of the authority. Thus, corruption can be hampered. Another consequent outcome is that the nation becomes appealing to both domestic and foreign investors, which boosts its economic growth a great deal. Given the freedom of speech, the press, or broadly speaking, the media, can also assist people in elections. Citizens can have a clearer view of the nominees through information from the media besides their campaigns to pick up the best person to lead the country. The other aspect is for each individual living in a society. Any citizen should be free to say what she believes is right and helpful for her life and her community. It means that people can speak up their opinion when there is something wrong, illegal, or negatively affect their lives. For instance, a group of citizens can show disapproval with an unfair policy on tax payment publicly through a demonstration or on the media. This can put pressure on the government to consider their request and work out a solution. If people’s voice is respected, they will feel that their need of self expression is satisfied. Thus, the community becomes worth-living with people with a high sense of well-being.
            <br>
            <br>
            In a nutshell, freedom of speech, once respected and guaranteed by law, is essential for a healthy society as it helps adjust the quality of the government and protect people from injustice. That is why it should be encouraged more widely.

            People have different views about the kind of support that wealthy nations should provide for poorer ones. Although some say that non-financial support is beneficial for poor countries, my own view is that international aid should be in the form of financial assistance.
            <br>
            <br>
            There are several reasons to believe that practical assistance and advice are what developing countries need. Firstly, an effective education system is a key factor in the growth of a country, so advice on how to build such a system should be given to less wealthy countries. For example, since the [your country name] school curriculum focuses heavily on theories, students cannot apply what they learn into practice and come up with creative ideas, which is why the country fails to make technological and economic progress. Advice and instructions from developed countries are therefore expected to help [your country name] improve their education system. Secondly, foreign assistance can also be given in terms of providing human resources. By having an additional number of well-educated and knowledgeable individuals work in their nations, hopefully less developed countries can escape from poverty. 
            <br>
            <br>
            However, I believe that financial support would be more useful for poorer nations. One argument is that even valuable ideas for education reform may be irrelevant if a country is financially disadvantaged. In the aforementioned example about [your country name], while it seems beneficial to re-organise the education system, this cannot happen in the short run because there are a variety of costs associated with education reform, such as purchasing learning tools and training teachers. Furthermore, financial resources provided by rich countries may help poorer ones invest in medical and scientific research. If a sufficient amount of money is spent on these areas, technological advances are significantly more likely to be made, and such innovations can help improve the economic growth of a nation.
            <br>
            <br>
            In conclusion, while some people argue that foreign aid given to poor countries should be non-financial, it seems to me that it is financial support that helps these nations escape from poverty.

            While some people think that reading books rather than watching TV is more beneficial for one’s imagination and language acquisition, I content that the role of the former in boosting intelligence and language ability is equal to the latter.
            <br>
            <br>
            One the one hand, books are instrumental in enhancing children’s imagination and development. A kid reading a fairly tale with illustration will have to think, fantasize and use their creativeness to comprehend ideas and reasoning, which in turn sharpen their mental skills. Moreover, reading books helps to improve language skills. Spending time reading a book which is not written in our mother tongue leads to the development of a strong language base referring to its vocabulary, or comprehending meaning of a word in different contexts. Besides, reading out a book for children is also an effective way to help them improve their communication skill, which is greatly stimulated as the kids grab a spoken word and use it in daily conversations.
            <br>
            <br>
            On the other hand, watching TV is considered an important activity as reading in order to cultivate one’s imaginativeness regarding its characteristics of programs. Firstly, when audiences watch a tourism channel for example, they are exposed to a wide range of knowledge by seizing images of worldwide landscapes or feel tastes of specialties in various geographical regions. The broadcasting of quiz shows serves as an efficient learning tool for both children and adults who prefer taking challenges which involve critical thinking. Secondly, the role of TV in boosting linguistic competence is pivotal. Recent English programs not only support audience to remember words easily by associating them with vivid images shown on the screen but catch their constant attention with entertaining aspects.
            <br>
            <br>
            In conclusion, while the benefits of reading are undeniable, they cannot outweigh the role of TV in enhancing a person’s imaginativeness and language skills.

            While it is argued that a distinguished career is regarded as the most pivotal thing in a person’s life, I strongly believe that there are other factors which can make people’s lifetime become meaningful.
            <br>
            <br>
            On the one hand, it cannot be denied that working plays an important role in one’s life. According to an annual survey carried out in the UK, a person spends about 25 or 30 years on their occupation, hence working time accounts for nearly one third of a person’s life. So if people obtain a worthwhile job that blooms, their lifetime is likely to be filled with human well-being. Additionally, the state of being stuck in an unsuccessful career might have a destructive influence on people’s spirits. Those with turbulent career or experience of job dissatisfaction could suffer from chronic stress and discouragement, which affects adversely their mental and physical health, as well as making them have a negative outlook on their lives.
            <br>
            <br>
            On the other hand, I contend that there are more desirable goals rather than a successful career to attain in our life. A vast majority of people perceive a meaningful life as helping others living in poor and underprivileged conditions. They spend most of their lifetime devoting to charity work. Furthermore, there are other people who do not enter workforce but seem satisfied with their lives. In some Asian countries such as Japan, dual-income families are not as common as that in Western nations. Take Japan as a telling example, men are often the breadwinners while women stay at home, take over the responsibilities related to household chores and childcare, which make they feel content as a well-established tradition.
            <br>
            <br>
            In conclusion, while undoubtedly people can benefit enormously from a glittering career, there are still a lot of significant factors which might enable them to lead a happy life.

            Indulging children has been a common parenting problem in many modern families. From my perspective, this practice exerts some immediate adverse impacts on children and also results in long-term consequences for them.
            <br>
            <br>
            In the short term, it is possible that over-indulgence causes some delay to the process in which children learn important life skills. This can be seen in a variety of age groups, ranging from toddlers to teenagers. For example, many over-caring parents spoon-feed their children until they are five or six, the developmental stage in which they should have already been able to eat independently. There is also a common practice that parents assist their pre-adolescent children in taking a bath or a shower. As a result, children may fail to acquire basic personal hygiene skills at the right time.
            <br>
            <br>
            In the long run, the consequences are even direr as over-indulged children grow up. If parents unconditionally satisfy all the needs of their children, they may have inadvertently made their children become over-dependent on other people. When these children enter adulthood, the inability to live independently can cause some difficulties for them to maintain their overall well-being, for instance, they may be unaware of what to do when they catch a fever. Furthermore, it is a norm that over-indulgent parents are lenient and do not require children to face the consequences of their misbehaviour. In general, this deprives children of the opportunities to learn from mistakes, which may cause their problem solving skills to be severely lacking in the future.
            <br>
            <br>
            From the issues outlined above, one can conclude that over-indulgence may produce a number of unfavourable effects on children, including the delay in gaining crucial life skills such as self-feeding and the long-term consequence of lacking the ability to cope with problems as adults in the future.

            Nowadays, people can travel and communicate more efficiently than before due to the advancements in science and technology. Although some people claim that it has a detrimental influence on individuals, nations and international societies, I personally believe its advantages far outweigh its disadvantages.
            <br>
            <br>
            One problem opponents of such speeding up often propose is that individuals bearing fast-pace of life today could lead to psychological diseases. For instance, business people are supposed to reply emails or telephones in a short time compared to dealing snail mails in the past. Time pressure could cause tension, hurting psychological conditions in the long term. However, tension is not as much as people might think because advanced technology allows people to do things in a short time rather than having them work overtime. Besides, the other side is that business people can also expect quick reply from others, which is conducive to their own business, too.
            <br>
            <br>
            Another hazard at the national and international level often being criticized is the environmental pollution. This means airplanes and cars today(which help speed up travelling) emit more CO2, which could destroy Ozone layer and is responsible for greenhouse effect. However, this assertion has some problems. It should not be neglected that visual conference on the internet—a result of speeding up in communication area—has considerably reduced the number of international meetings face to face, that means, less travelling.
            <br>
            <br>
            Such speeding up has some benefits. To begin with, it improves individuals’ efficiency and help to increase a country’s GDP. It is because people could do more work in less time today, producing more revenues for businesses, thereby enhancing a country’s economic power. Moreover, it helps to improve international exchange and communication. People can easily get the latest information worldwide including those from faraway regions, which is beneficial for international understanding.
            <br>
            <br>
            To conclude, the speeding up of life in travel and communication areas brings more benefits than drawbacks to individuals, nations and international societies.

            It is often said that individuals settling down with a permanent career soon seem to experience further satisfaction in their work than social members regularly altering their employment. However, from my standpoint, both these options could bestow comparable feelings of fulfillment.
            <br>
            <br>
            On the one hand, it is undeniable that numerous people who can opt for a job early and maintain it may reap pleasure in their work. When realizing the job they have a craving for earlier in their life and might land this kind of job, individuals are likely to grasp privileges to expose to the majority of their aptitudes, skills and their expertise on their work. As a result, it is easy for them to make progress in their career and receive a high salary which may meet their requirements for entertainment or education. It is unquestionable that these appear to help create satisfactory with their job.
            <br>
            <br>
            Notwithstanding, it is my conviction that individuals, who frequently hopping their jobs, can be likewise content with their employment. The first explanation is that when regularly changing their jobs, they may have multiple opportunities to accumulate diverse majors, skills and knowledge. Thus, they may step out of their comfort zones in order to experience feelings of satisfaction. Another cause could be that by virtue of regularly shifting their employment, social workers are likely to find the most appropriate position with their personal competences and aspiration. Hence, it would seem that job hoppers can also achieve exaltation in working.
            <br>
            <br>
            Overall, it is sensible to conclude that not only people making an early choice of work and pursue it for their whole life but also individuals often changing their position can equally get satisfactory in their career.
