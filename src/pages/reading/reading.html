      <p>
        You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 1-15, which are based on Reading Passage 1 below.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Questions 1-5</b><br>
        <br>
        <i>Reading Passage 1 below has 5 paragraphs (A-E). Which paragraph focuses on the Infor­mation below? Write the appropriate letters (A-E) in Boxes 1-5 on your answer sheet.<br></i>
        <br> NB. Write only ONE letter for each answer.<br>
        <br>
        <b>1.</b> The way parameters in the mind help people to be creative<br>
        <b>2.</b> The need to learn rules in order to break them<br>
        <b>3.</b> How habits restrict us and limit creativity<br>
        <b>4.</b> How to train the mind to be creative<br>
        <b>5.</b> How the mind is trapped by the desire for order<br>
        <br>
        <b>A. </b> &nbsp; It is a myth that creative people arc born with their talents: gifts from God or nature. Cre­ative
        genius is, in fact, latent within many of us, without our realising, But how far do we need to travel to find the
        path to creativity? For many people, a long way, In our everyday lives, we have to perform many acts out of habit
        to survive, like opening the door, shaving, getting dressed, walking to work, and so on. If this were not the case,
        we would, in all probability, become mentally unhinged. So strongly ingrained are our habits, though this varies
        from person to person, that, sometimes, when a conscious effort is made to be cre­ative, automatic response takes
        over. We may try, for example, to walk to work following a different route, but end up on our usual path. By then
        it is too late to go back and change our minds. Another day, perhaps. The same applies to all other areas of our
        lives. When we arc solving problems, for example, we may seek different answers, but, often as not, find ourselves
        walking along the same well-trodden paths.<br>
        <br>
        <b>B. </b> &nbsp; So, for many people, their actions and behaviour arc set in immovable blocks, their minds clogged
        with the cholesterol of habitual actions, preventing them from operating freely, and thereby stifling creation. Unfortunately,
        mankind’s very struggle for survival has be­come a tyranny – the obsessive desire to give order to the world is a
        case in point. Witness people’s attitude to time, social customs and the panoply of rules and regulations by which
        the human mind is now circumscribcd.<br>
        <br>
        <b>C. </b> &nbsp; The groundwork for keeping Creative ability in check begins at school. School, later uni­versity
        and then work teach us to regulate our lives, imposing a continuous process of re­strictions, which is increasing
        exponentially with the advancement of technology. Is it surprising then that creative ability appears to be so rare?
        It is trapped in the prison that we have erected. Yet, even here in this hostile environment, the foundations for
        creativity arc being laid; because setting off on the creative path is also partly about using rules and regulations,
        Such limitations arc needed so that once they arc learnt, they can be broken.<br>
        <br>
        <b>D. </b> &nbsp; The truly creative mind is often seen as totally free and unfettered. But a better image is of
        a mind, which can be free when it wants, and one that rccogniscs that rules and regula­tions arc parameters, or barriers,
        to be raised and dropped again at will. An example of how the human mind can be trained to be creative might help
        here. People’s minds arc just like tense muscles that need to be freed up and the potential unlocked. One strategy
        is to erect artificial barriers or hurdles in solving a problem, As a form of stimulation, the participants in the
        task can be forbidden to use particular solutions or to follow certain lines of thought to solve a problem. In this
        way, they arc obliged to explore unfamiliar ter­ritory, which may lead to some startling discoveries. Unfortunately,
        the difficulty in this ex­ercise, and with creation itself, is convincing people that création is possible, shrouded
        as It is in so much myth and legend. There is also an element of fear involved, however sub­liminal, as deviating
        from the safety of one’s own thought patterns is very much akin to madness. But, open Pandora’s box, and a whole
        new world unfolds before your very eyes.<br>
        <br>
        <b>E. </b> &nbsp; Lifting barriers into place also plays a major part in helping the mind to control ideas rather
        than letting them collide at random. Parameters act as containers for ideas, and thus help the mind to fix on them.
        When the mind is thinking laterally, and two ideas from different areas of the brain come or are brought together,
        they form a new idea, just like atoms floating around and then forming a molecule. Once the idea has been formed,
        it needs to be contained or it will fly away, so fleeting is its passage. The mind needs to hold it in place for
        a time so that it can recognise it or call on it again. And then the para­meters can act as channels along which
        the ideas can flow, developing and expanding. When the mind has brought the idea to fruition by thinking it through
        to its final conclu­sion, the parameters can be brought down and the idea allowed to float off and comc in contact
        with other ideas.<br>

          <p>
            <b>1 : E.</b> The paragraph Is about the fact that parameters help our minds to be creative.<br>
            <b>2 : C.</b> The answer lies in the key phrases: … keeping creative ability in check (in the first sentence)
            and Such limitations are needed so that once they are learnt, they can be broken (the last sentence of the paragraph).
            The focus sentence is a combina­tion of these two ideas. Note how the word yet divides the paragraph. It indicates
            the focus of the paragraph against the background in the first part. It also marks the division of Information
            In the whole passage.<br>
            <b>3 : A.</b> The writer wrote the paragraph to show that habits limit our creativity and the habits we need
            to survive play a role in this limitation.<br>
            <b>4 : D.</b> The theme of the paragraph is how creativity works.<br>
            <b>5 : B.</b> The paragraph deals with how parameters help the mind to be creative.<br>
            <b>6 : C.</b> The answer is in the first line of the passage: It is a myth that creative people are born with
            their talents. Here, it is a myth = are not.<br>
            <b>7 : C.</b> The answer is In paragraph A. The actual words are not in the paragraph, but the meaning is clear.
            A is not correct, because this is a myth; B is not correct, because the passage states that when we try to be
            creative, our automatic response takes over. D is not correct, because the well-trodden paths prevent creativity.
            Compare number 13 below.<br>
            <b>8 : D.</b> The answer is in paragraph B: Unfortunately, mankind’s very struggle for survival has become a
            tyranny. The answer paraphrases this statement. A is not cor­rect, because the passage says the struggle has
            become, i.e. is a tyranny, not that it is becoming so; B is not correct, because cholesterol is not mentioned
            in relationship to the brain, but the mind, C is incorrect, because it is the mind which is circumscribed.<br>
            <b>9 : A.</b> The answer is in paragraph C: a continuous process of restrictions, which is increasing exponentially
            with the advancement of technology. The statement Is a paraphrase of this section. Note B and C are basically
            the same; it is, therefore, not possible to have cither of these two alternatives as your answer. Watch out for
            this feature In multiple choice questions.<br>
            <b>10 : D.</b> The answer is in paragraph C: Is it surprising then that creative ability appears to be so raref.
            This is a question and has the same meaning as the statement given, i.e. It is not surprising. Note C is not
            possible, because the passage doesn’t indicate whether the rarity is increasing or decreasing.<br>
            <b>11 : Yes.</b> The answer is at the beginning of paragraph D: … and one that recognises that rules and regulations
            are parameters….<br>
            <b>12 : Not Given.</b> There is no reference to this statement in the passage.<br>
            <b>13 : Yes.</b> The answer Is In paragraph D: The difficulty in this exercise and with creation itself, is convincing
            people that creation is possible. The answer is a paraphrase of this part of the text. Compare number 7 above,<br>
            <b>14 : Yes.</b> The answer is at the end of paragraph D: leaving the safety of one’s own thought patterns is
            very much akin to madness; akin to – like.<br>
            <b>15 : Yes.</b> The answer is in the latter half of paragraph E<br>

        <h2><b>Locked Doors, Open Access</b></h2><br>
      </div>
      <p>
        The word, “security”, has both positive and negative connotations. Most of us would say that we crave security for all its
        positive virtues, both physical and psychological – its evocation of the safety of home, of undying love, or of freedom
        from need. More negatively, the word nowadays conjures up images of that huge industry which has developed to protect
        indi­viduals and property from invasion by ‘‘outsiders”, ostensibly malicious and intent on theft or wilful damage.<br>
        <br> Increasingly, because they arc situated in urban areas of escalating crime, those buildings which used to allow
        free access to employees and other users (buildings such as offices, schools, colleges or hospitals) now do not.
        Entry areas which in another age were called “Reception” arc now manned by security staff. Receptionists, whose task
        It was to receive visitors and to make them welcome before passing them on to the person they had come to see, have
        been replaced by those whose task it is to bar entry to the unauthorized, the unwanted or the plain unappealing.
        <br>
        <br> Inside, these buildings are divided into “secure zones” which often have all the trappings of combination locks
        and burglar alarms. These devices bar entry to the uninitiated, hinder circulation, and create parameters of time
        and space for user access. Within the spaces created by these zones, Individual rooms are themselves under lock and
        key, which is a particular problem when it means that working space becomes compartmentalized.<br>
        <br> To combat the consequent difficulty of access to people at a physical level, we have now developed technological
        access. Computers sit on every desk and are linked to one another, and in many cases to an external universe of other
        computers, so that messages can be passed to and fro. Here too, security plays part, since we must not be allowed
        access to messages destined for others. And so the password was Invented. Now correspondence be­tween individuals
        goes from desk to desk and cannot be accessed by colleagues. Library catalogues can be searched from one’s desk.
        Papers can be delivered to, and received from, other people at the press of a button.<br>
        <br> And yet it seems that, just as work is isolating individuals more and more, organizations are recognizing the
        advantages of “team-work”; perhaps in order to encourage employees to talk to one another again. Yet, how can groups
        work in teams if the possibilities for communication are reduced? How can they work together If e-mail provides a
        convenient electronic shield behind which the blurring of public and private can be exploited by the less scrupulous?
        If voice-mail walls up messages behind a password? If I can’t leave a mes­sage on my colleague’s desk because his
        office is locked?<br>
        <br> Team-work conceals the fact that another kind of security, “job security”, is almost always not on offer. Just
        as organizations now recognize three kinds of physical resources: those they buy, those they lease long-term and
        those they rent short-term – so it is with their hu­man resources. Some employees have permanent contracts, some
        have short-term con­tracts, and some arc regarded simply as casual labour.<br>
        <br> Telecommunication systems offer us the direct line, which means that individuals can be contacted without the
        caller having to talk to anyone else. Voice-mail and the answer- phone mean that Individuals can communicate without
        ever actually talking to one an­other. If we are unfortunate enough to contact an organization with a sophisticated
        touch-tone dialling system, we can buy things and pay for them without ever speaking to a human being.<br>
        <br> To combat this closing in on ourselves we have the Internet, which opens out communica­tion channels more widely
        than anyone could possibly want or need. An individual’s elec­tronic presence on the Internet is known as the “Home
        Page” – suggesting the safety and security of an electronic hearth. An elaborate system of 3-dimensional graphics
        distin­guishes this very 2-dlmenslonai medium of “web sites”. The nomenclature itself creates the illusion of a geographical
        entity, that the person sitting before the computer is travelling, when in fact the “site” is coming to him. “Addresses”
        of one kind or another move to the individual, rather than the individual moving between them, now that location
        is no longer geographical.<br>
        <br> An example of this is the mobile phone. I am now not available either at home or at work, but wherever I take
        my mobile phone. Yet, even now, we cannot cscapc the security of wanting to “locate” the person at the other end.
        It is no coincidence that almost everyone we see answering or Initiating a mobile phone-call In public begins by
        saying where he or she is.<br>

        <h2><b>National Cuisine and Tourism</b></h2><br>
      </div>
      <p>
        To an extent, agriculture dictates that every country should have a set of specific foods which are native to that country.
        They may even be unique, However, even allowing for the power of agricultural science, advances in food distribution
        and changes in food economics to alter the ethnocentric properties of food, it is still possible for a country “to
        be famous for” a particular food even if it is widely available elsewhere.<br>
        <br> The degree to which cuisine is embedded in national culture within the sociology of food literature two themes
        suggest that food is linked to social cul­ture. The first relates food and eating to social relationships, (Finkelsteln,
        Vlssor, Wood), and the second establishes food as a reflection of the distribution of power within social structures,
        (Mennell). However, establishing a role for food in personal relationships and social structures is not a sufficient
        argument to place food at the centre of national culture, To do that it is necessary to prove a degree of embeddedness.
        It would be appropriate at this point to consider the nature of culture.<br>
        <br> The distinction made by Pierce between a behavioural contingency and a cultural contin­gency is crucial to our
        understanding of culture. Whilst a piece of behaviour may take place very often, involve a network of people and
        be reproducible by other networks who do not know each other, the meaning of the behaviour does not go beyond the
        activity itself. A cultural practice, however, contains and represents ‘’meta-contingencies” that is, behav­ioural
        practices that have a social meaning greater than the activity itself and which, by their nature reinforce the culture
        which houses them. Celebrating birthdays is a cultural practice not because everybody does it but because it has
        a religious meaning. Contrast this with the practice in Britain of celebrating “Guy Fawkes Night”. It is essentially
        an excuse for a good time but if fireworks were banned, the occasion would gradually die away alto­gether or end
        up as cult to California. A smaller scale example might be more useful. In the British context, compare drinking
        in pubs with eating “fish and chips”. Both arc common practices, yet the former reflects something of the social
        fabric of the country, particularly family, gender, class and age relationships whilst the latter is just a national
        habit. In other words, a constant, well-populated pattern of behaviour is not necessarily cultural. However, it is
        also clear that a cultural practice needs behavioural reinforcement. Social culture is not immortal.<br>
        <br> Pinkelstein argues that “dining out” is simply “action which supports a surface life”. For him it is the word
        “out” that disconnects food from culture. This view of culture and food placcs the “home’’ as the cultural centre.
        Continental European eating habits may contra­dict this notion by their general acceptance of eating out as part
        of family life. Following the principle that culture needs behavioural reinforcement, if everyone “eats out” on a
        regu­lar basis, irrespective of social and economic differentiation, then this might constitute behavioural support
        for cuisine being part of social culture. That aside, the significance of a behavioural practice being embedded In
        culture is that it naturally maintains an approved and accepted way of life and therefore has a tendency to resist
        change.
        <br>
        <br> The thrust of the argument is that countries differ in the degree to which their food and eating habits have
        a social and cultural meaning beyond the behaviour itself. This argu­ment, however, could be Interpreted to imply
        that the country with the greatest proportion of meals taken outside the home would be the one In which the national
        cuisine is more embedded in social culture. This is a difficult position to maintain because it would bring America,
        with its fast-food culture to the fore. The fast-food culture of America raises the issue of whether there are qualitative
        criteria for the concept of cuisine. The key Issue is not the extent of the common behaviour but whether or not it
        has a function in maintain­ing social cohesion and Is appreciated and valued through social norms. French cuisine
        and “going down the pub” arc strange bedfellows but bedfellows nevertheless.<br>
        <br> How homogenous is national cuisinef like language, cuisine is not a static entity and whilst Its fundamental
        character is unlikely to change in the short run it may evolve in different directions. Just as in a language there
        arc dialects so in a cuisine there arc variations. The two principal sources of diversity arc the physical geography
        of the country and its social diversity.<br>
        <br> The geographical dimensions work through agriculture to particularise and to limit locally produced Ingredients.
        Ethnic diversity in the population works through the role of cuisine in social identity to create ethnically distinct
        cuisincs which may not converge into a na­tional cuisine. This raises the question of how far a national cuisine
        is related to national borders. To an ethnic group their cuisine is national. The greater the division of a society
        into classes, castes and status groups with their attendant ethnocentric properties, of which cuisine is a part,
        then the greater will be the diversity of the cuisincs.<br>
        <br> However, there is a case for convergence. Both these principal sources of diversity arc, to an extent, influenced
        by the strength of their boundaries and the willingness of society to erode them. It Is a question of isolation and
        integration. Efficient transport and the applica­tion of chemistry can alter agricultural boundaries to make a wider
        range of foods available to a cuisinc. Similarly, political and social Integration can erode ethnic boundaries. How­ever,
        all these arguments mean nothing if the cuisine is not embedded in social culture. Riley argues that when a cuisine
        is not embedded in social culture It is susceptible to novelty and Invasion by other cuisincs.<br>

        <h2><b>Dirty River But Clean Water</b></h2><br>
      </div>
      <p>
        <i>Floods can occur in rivers when the flow rate exceeds the capacity of the river channel, particularly at bends or meanders in the waterway. Floods often cause damage to homes and businesses if they are in the natural flood plains of rivers. While riverine flood damage can be eliminated by moving away from rivers and other bodies of water, people have traditionally lived and worked by rivers because the land is usually flat and fertile and because rivers provide easy travel and access to commerce and  industry.</i>
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>A. </b>&nbsp; Fire and flood are two of humanity’s worst nightmares. People have,therefore,always sought to control
        them. Forest fires are snuffed out quickly. The flow of rivers is regulated by weirs and dams. At least, that is
        how it used to be. But foresters have learned that forests need fires to clear out the brash and even to get seeds
        to germinate. And a similar revelation is now – dawning on hydrologists. Rivers – and the ecosystems they support
        – need floods. That is why a man-made torrent has been surging down the Grand Canyon. By Thursday March 6th it was
        running at full throttle, which was expected to be sustained for 60 hours.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>B. </b>&nbsp; Floods once raged through the canyon every year. Spring Snow from as far away as Wyoming would melt
        and swell the Colorado river to a flow that averaged around 1,500 cubic metres (50,000 cubic feet) a second. Every
        eight years or so, that figure rose to almost 3,000 cubic metres. These floods infused the river with sediment, carved
        its beaches and built its sandbars.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>C. </b>&nbsp; However, in the four decades since the building of the Glen Canyon dam, just upstream of the Grand
        Canyon, the only sediment that it has collected has come from tiny, undammed tributaries. Even that has not been
        much use as those tributaries are not powerful enough to distribute the sediment in an ecologically valuable way.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>D. </b>&nbsp; This lack of flooding has harmed local wildlife. The humpback chub,for example, thrived in the rust-redwaters
        of the Colorado. Recently, though, its population has crashed. At first sight, it looked as if the reason was that
        the chub were being eaten by trout introduced for sport fishing in the mid-20th century. But trout and chub co-existed
        until the Glen Canyon dam was built, so something else is going on. Steve Gloss, of the United States’ Geological
        Survey (USGS), reckons that the chub’s decline is the result of their losing their most valuable natural defense,
        the Colorado’s rusty sediment. The chub were well adapted to the poor visibility created by the thick, red water
        which gave the river its name,and depended on it to hide from predators. Without the cloudy water the chub became
        vulnerable.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>E. </b>&nbsp; And the chub are not alone. In the years since the Glen Canyon dam was built, several species have
        vanished altogether. These include the Colorado pike-minnow, the razorback sucker and the round-tail chub. Meanwhile,
        aliens including fathead minnows, channel catfish and common carp, which would have been hard, put to survive in
        the savage waters of the undammed canyon, have move din.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>F. </b>&nbsp; So flooding is the obvious answer. Unfortunately, it is easier said than done. Floods were sent
        down the Grand Canyon in 1996 and 2004 and the results were mixed. In 1996 the flood was allowed to go on too long.
        To start with,all seemed well. The floodwaters built up sandbanks and infused the river with sediment. Eventually,
        however, the continued flow washed most of the sediment out of the canyon. This problem was avoided in 2004, but
        unfortunately, on that occasion, the volume of sand available behind the dam was too low to rebuild the sandbanks.
        This time, the USGS is convinced that things will be better. The amount of sediment available is three times greater
        than it was in 2004. So if a flood is going to do some good, this is the time to unleash one.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>G. </b>&nbsp; Even so, it may turn out to be an empty gesture. At less than 1,200 cubic metres a second, this
        flood is smaller than even an average spring flood, let alone one of the mightier deluges of the past. Those glorious
        inundations moved massive quantities of sediment through the Grand Canyon,wiping the slate dirty, and making a muddy
        mess of silt and muck that would make modern river rafters cringe.

        <b>The eco-impact of the Canyon Dam</b><br>
        <br> Floods are people’s nightmare. In the past, canyon was raged by flood every year. The snow from far Wyoming
        would melt in the season of <b>8</b>…………………… and caused a flood flow peak in Colorado river. In the four decades

        Meanwhile, some moved in such as fathead minnows, channel catfish and <b>11</b>…………………… . The non-stopped flow leaded
        to the washing away of the sediment out of the canyon, which poses great threat to the chubs because it has poor
        <b>12</b>…………………… away from predators. In addition, the volume of <b>13</b>…………………… available behind the dam was

      <p>
        <b>A. </b>&nbsp; The world’s favourite fruit could disappear forever in 10 years’ time. The banana is among the world’s
        oldest crops. Agricultural scientists believe that the first edible banana was discovered around ten thousand years
        ago. It has been at an evolutionary standstill ever since it was first propagated in the jungles of South-East Asia
        at the end of the last ice age. Normally the wild banana, a giant jungle herb called Musa acuminata, contains a mass
        of hard seeds that make the fruit virtually inedible. But now and then, hunter-gatherers must have discovered rare
        mutant plants that produced seedless, edible fruits. Geneticists now know that the vast majority of these soft-fruited
        plants resulted from genetic accidents that gave their cells three copies of each chromosome instead of the usual
        two. This imbalance prevents seeds and pollen from developing normally, rendering the mutant plants sterile. And
        that is why some scientists believe the world’s most popular fruit could be doomed. It lacks the genetic diversity
        to fight off pests and diseases that are invading the banana plantations of Central America and the small-holdings
        of Africa and Asia alike.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>B. </b>&nbsp; In some ways, the banana today resembles the potato before blight brought famine to Ireland a century
        and a half ago. But “it holds a lesson for other crops, too”, says Emile Frison, top banana at the International
        Network for the Improvement of Banana and Plantain in Montpellier, France. “The state of the banana”, Frison warns,
        “can teach a broader lesson: the increasing standardisation of food crops round the world is threatening their ability
        to adapt and survive.”
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>C. </b>&nbsp; The first Stone Age plant breeders cultivated these sterile freaks by replanting cuttings from their
        stems. And the descendants of those original cuttings are the bananas we still eat today. Each is a virtual clone,
        almost devoid of genetic diversity. And that uniformity makes it ripe for disease like no other crop on Earth. Traditional
        varieties of sexually reproducing crops have always had a much broader genetic base, and the genes will recombine
        in new arrangements in each generation. This gives them much greater flexibility in evolving responses to disease
        – and far more genetic resources to draw on in the face of an attack. But that advantage is fading fast, as growers
        increasingly plant the same few, high-yielding varieties. Plant breeders work feverishly to maintain resistance in
        these standardized crops. Should these efforts falter, yields of even the most productive crop could swiftly crash.
        “When some pest or disease comes along, severe epidemics can occur,” says Geoff Hawtin, director of the Rome-based
        International Plant Genetic Resources Institute.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>D. </b>&nbsp; The banana is an excellent case in point. Until the 1950s, one variety, the Gros Michel, dominated
        the world’s commercial banana business. Found by French botanists in Asian the 1820s, the Gros Michel was by all
        accounts a fine banana, richer and sweeter than today’s standard banana and without the latte’s bitter aftertaste
        when green. But it was vulnerable to a soil fungus that produced a wilt known as Panama disease. “Once the fungus
        gets into the soil it remains there for many years. There is nothing farmers can do. Even chemical spraying won’t
        get rid of it,” says Rodomiro Ortiz, director of the Inter-national Institute for Tropical Agriculture in Ibadan,
        Nigeria. So plantation owners played a running game, abandoning infested fields and moving to “clean” land – until
        they ran out of clean land in the 1950s and had to abandon the Gros Michel. Its successor, and still the reigning
        commercial king, is the Cavendish banana, a 19th-century British discovery from southern China. The Cavendish is
        resistant to Panama disease and, as a result, it literally saved the international banana industry. During the 1960s,
        it replaced the Gros Michel on supermarket shelves. If you buy a banana today, it is almost certainly a Cavendish.
        But even so, it is a minority in the world’s banana crop.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>E. </b>&nbsp; Half a billion people in Asia and Africa depend on bananas. Bananas provide the largest source of
        calories and are eaten daily. Its name is synonymous with food. But the day of reckoning may be coming for the Cavendish
        and its indigenous kin. Another fungal disease, black Sigatoka, has become a global epidemic since its first appearance
        in Fiji in 1963. Left to itself, black Sigatoka which causes brown wounds on leaves and premature fruit ripening
        – cuts fruit yields by 50 to 70 per cent and reduces the productive lifetime of banana plants from 30 years to as
        little as 2 or 3. Commercial growers keep Sigatoka at bay by a massive chemical assault. Forty sprayings of fungicide
        a year is typical. But despite the fungicides, diseases such as black Sigatoka are getting more and more difficult
        to control. “As soon as you bring in a new fungicide, they develop resistance,” says Frison. “One thing we can be
        sure of is that the Sigatoka won’t lose in this battle.” Poor farmers, who cannot afford chemicals, have it even
        worse. They can do little more than watch their plants die. “Most of the banana fields in Amazonia have already been
        destroyed by the disease,” says Luadir Gasparotto, Brazil’s leading banana pathologist with the government research
        agency EMBRAPA. Production is likely to fall by 70 percent as the disease spreads, he predicts. The only option will
        be to find a new variety.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>F. </b>&nbsp; But how? Almost all edible varieties are susceptible to the diseases, so growers cannot simply change
        to a different banana. With most crops, such a threat would unleash an army of breeders, scouring the world for resistant
        relatives whose traits they can breed into commercial varieties. Not so with the banana. Because all edible varieties
        are sterile, bringing in new genetic traits to help cope with pests and diseases is nearly impossible. Nearly, but
        not totally. Very rarely, a sterile banana will experience a genetic accident that allows an almost normal seed to
        develop, giving breeders a tiny window for improvement. Breeders at the Honduran Foundation of Agricultural Research
        have tried to exploit this to create disease-resistant varieties. Further backcrossing with wild bananas yielded
        a new seedless banana resistant to both black Sigatoka and Panama disease.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>G. </b>&nbsp; Neither Western supermarket consumers nor peasant growers like the new hybrid. Some accuse it of
        tasting more like an apple than a banana. Not surprisingly, the majority of plant breeders have till now turned their
        backs on the banana and got to work on easier plants. And commercial banana companies are now washing their hands
        of the whole breeding effort, preferring to fund a search for new fungicides instead. “We supported a breeding programme
        for 40 years, but it wasn’t able to develop an alternative to Cavendish. It was very expensive and we got nothing
        back,” says Ronald Romero, head of research at Chiquita, one of the Big Three companies that dominate the international
        banana trade.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>H. </b>&nbsp; Last year, a global consortium of scientists led by Frison announced plans to sequence the banana
        genome within five years. It would be the first edible fruit to be sequenced. Well, almost edible. The group will
        actually be sequencing inedible wild bananas from East Asia because many of these are resistant to black Sigatoka.
        If they can pinpoint the genes that help these wild varieties to resist black Sigatoka, the protective genes could
        be introduced into laboratory tissue cultures of cells from edible varieties. These could then be propagated into
        new, resistant plants and passed on to farmers.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>I. </b>&nbsp; It sounds promising, but the big banana companies have, until now, refused to get involved in GM
        research for fear of alienating their customers. “Biotechnology is extremely expensive and there are serious questions
        about consumer acceptance,” says David McLaughlin, Chiquita’s senior director for environmental affairs. With scant
        funding from the companies, the banana genome researchers are focusing on the other end of the spectrum. Even if
        they can identify the crucial genes, they will be a long way from developing new varieties that smallholders will
        find suitable and affordable. But whatever biotechnology’s academic interest, it is the only hope for the banana.
        Without banana production worldwide will head into a tailspin. We may even see the extinction of the banana as both
        a lifesaver for hungry and impoverished Africans and as the most popular product on the world’s supermarket shelves.

        <h2><b>Blue-footed Boobies 2</b></h2><br>
      </div>
      <p>
        <b>A </b>&nbsp; Boobies are a small group of seabirds native to tropical and subtropical oceans throughout the world.
        Their diet consists mainly of fish. They are specialized fish eaters feeding on small school fish like sardines,
        anchovies, mackerel, and flying fish. When their prey is in sight, they fold their long wings back around their streamlined
        bodies and plunge into the water from as high as 80 feet, so streamlined they barely make a splash. They travel in
        parties of about 12 to areas of water with large schools of small fish. When the lead bird sees a fish shoal in the
        water, it will signal the rest of the group and they will all dive together. Surprisingly, individuals do not eat
        with the hunting group, preferring to eat on their own, usually in the early morning or late afternoon.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>B </b>&nbsp; There are three varieties on the Galapagos: the blue-footed, red-footed, and masked boobies. They
        are all members of the same family, and are not only different in appearance but also in behaviours. The blue-footed
        and red-footed boobies mate throughout the year, while the masked boobies have an annual mating cycle that differs
        from island to island. All catch fish in a similar manner, but in different areas: the blue-footed booby does its
        fishing close to shore, while the masked booby goes slightly farther out, and the red-footed booby fishes at the
        farthest distances from shore.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>C </b>&nbsp; Although it is unknown where the name “Booby” emanates from, some conjecture it may come from the
        Spanish word for clown, “bobo”, meaning “stupid”. Its name was probably inspired by the bird’s clumsiness on land
        and apparently unwarranted bravery. The blue footed booby is extremely vulnerable to human visitors because it does
        not appear to fear them. Therefore these birds received such name for their clumsiness on land in which they were
        easily, captured, killed, and eaten by humans.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>D </b>&nbsp; The blue-footed booby’s characteristic feet play a significant part in their famous courtship ceremony,
        the ‘booby dance’. The male walks around the female, raising his bright blue feet straight up in the air, while bringing
        his ‘shoulders’ towards the ground and crossing the bottom tips of his wings high above the ground. Plus he’ll raise
        his bill up towards the sky to try to win his mate over. The female may also partake in these activities – lifting
        her feet, sky pointing, and of course squawking at her mate. After mating, another ritual occurs – the nest-building
        which ironically is never used because they nest on the bare ground. When the female is ready to lay her eggs, they
        scrape the existing nest away so she can nest on exposed ground. Sun-baked islands form the booby’s breeding grounds.
        When ready the female Blue Footed Booby lays one to three eggs.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>E </b>&nbsp; After mating, two or three eggs are laid in a shallow depression on flat or gently sloping ground.
        Both male and female take turns incubating the eggs. Unlike most birds, booby doesn’t develop brood patches (areas
        of bare skin on the breast) to warm the eggs during incubation. Instead, it uses its broad webbed feet, which have
        large numbers of prominent blood vessels, to transmit heat essential for incubation. The eggs are thick-shelled so
        they can withstand the full weight of an incubating bird.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>F </b>&nbsp; After hatching, the male plays a major role in bringing fish home. He can bring back a constant supply
        of small fish for the chicks, which must be fed continuously. The reason is that the male has a longer tail than
        the female in relation to his body size, which makes him able to execute shallower dives and to feed closer to shore.
        Then the female takes a greater part as time proceeds. Sooner or later, the need to feed the young becomes greater
        than the need to protect them and both adults must fish to provide enough.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>G </b>&nbsp; When times are good, the parents may successfully fledge all three chicks, but, in harder times,
        they may still lay as many eggs yet only obtain enough food to raise one. The problem is usually solved by the somewhat
        callous-sounding system of “opportunistic sibling murder.” The first-born chick is larger and stronger than its nest
        mate(s) as a result of hatching a few days earlier and also because the parents feed the larger chick. If food is
        scarce, the first born will get more food than its nest mate(s) and will outcompete them, causing them to starve.
        The above system optimizes the reproductive capacity of the blue-foot in an unpredictable environment. The system
        ensures that, if possible, at least one chick will survive a period of shortage rather than all three dying of starvation
        under a more ‘humane’ system.

        <h2><b>Mammoth kill 2</b></h2><br>
      </div>
      <p>
        A mammoth is any species of the extinct genus Mammuthus, proboscideans commonly equipped with long, curved tusks and, in
        northern species, a covering of long hair. They lived from the Pliocene epoch (from around 5 million years ago) into
        the Holocene at about 4,500 years ago, and were members of the family Elephantidae, which contains, along with mammoths,
        the two genera of modern elephants and their ancestors.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>A </b>&nbsp; Like their modern relatives, mammoths were quite large. The largest known species reached heights
        in the region of 4 m at the shoulder and weights of up to 8 tonnes, while exceptionally large males may have exceeded
        12 tonnes. However, most species of mammoth were only about as large as a modern Asian elephant. Both sexes bore
        tusks. A first, small set appeared at about the age of six months, and these were replaced at about 18 months by
        the permanent set. Growth of the permanent set was at a rate of about 2.5 to 15.2 cm per year. Based on studies of
        their close relatives, the modern elephants, mammoths probably had a gestation period of 22 months, resulting in
        a single calf being born. Their social structure was probably the same as that of African and Asian elephants, with
        females living in herds headed by a matriarch, whilst bulls lived solitary lives or formed loose groups after sexual
        maturity.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>B </b>&nbsp; MEXICO CITY – Although it’s hard to imagine in this age of urban sprawl and automobiles, North America
        once belonged to mammoths, camels, ground sloths as large as cows, bear-size beavers and other formidable beasts.
        Some 11,000 years ago, however, these large-bodied mammals and others – about 70 species in all – disappeared. Their
        demise coincided roughly with the arrival of humans in the New World and dramatic climatic change – factors that
        have inspired several theories about the die-off. Yet despite decades of scientific investigation, the exact cause
        remains a mystery. Now new findings offer support to one of these controversial hypotheses: that human hunting drove
        this megafaunal menagerie to extinction. The overkill model emerged in the 1960s, when it was put forth by Paul S.
        Martin of the University of Arizona. Since then, critics have charged that no evidence exists to support the idea
        that the first Americans hunted to the extent necessary to cause these extinctions. But at the annual meeting of
        the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology in Mexico City last October, paleoecologist John Alroy of the University of
        California at Santa Barbara argued that, in fact, hunting-driven extinction is not only plausible, it was unavoidable.
        He has determined, using a computer simulation, that even a very modest amount of hunting would have wiped these
        animals out.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>C </b>&nbsp; Assuming an initial human population of 100 people that grew no more than 2 percent annually, Alroy
        determined that if each band of, say, 50 people killed 15 to 20 large mammals a year, humans could have eliminated
        the animal populations within 1,000 years. Large mammals in particular would have been vulnerable to the pressure
        because they have longer gestation periods than smaller mammals and their young require extended care.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>D </b>&nbsp; Not everyone agrees with Alroy’s assessment. For one, the results depend in part on population-size
        estimates for the extinct animals – figures that are not necessarily reliable. But a more specific criticism comes
        from mammalogist Ross D. E. MacPhee of the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, who points out that
        the relevant archaeological record contains barely a dozen examples of stone points embedded in mammoth bones (and
        none, it should be noted, are known from other megafaunal remains) – hardly what one might expect if hunting drove
        these animals to extinction. Furthermore, some of these species had huge ranges – the giant Jefferson’s ground sloth,
        for example, lived as far north as the Yukon and as far south as Mexico – which would have made slaughtering them
        in numbers sufficient to cause their extinction rather implausible, he says.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>E </b>&nbsp; MacPhee agrees that humans most likely brought about these extinctions (as well as others around
        the world that coincided with human arrival), but not directly. Rather he suggests that people may have introduced
        hyperlethal disease, perhaps through their dogs or hitchhiking vermin, which then spread wildly among the immunologically
        naive species of the New World. As in the overkill model, populations of large mammals would have a harder time recovering.
        Repeated outbreaks of a hyperdisease could thus quickly drive them to the point of no return. So far MacPhee does
        not have empirical evidence for the hyperdisease hypothesis, and it won’t be easy to come by: hyperlethal disease
        would kill far too quickly to leave its signature on the bones themselves. But he hopes that analyses of tissue and
        DNA from the last mammoths to perish will eventually reveal murderous microbes.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>F </b>&nbsp; The third explanation for what brought on this North American extinction does not involve human beings.
        Instead its proponents blame the loss on the weather. The Pleistocene epoch witnessed considerable climatic instability,
        explains paleontologist Russell W. Graham of the Denver Museum of Nature and Science. As a result, certain habitats
        disappeared, and species that had once formed communities split apart. For some animals, this change brought opportunity.
        For much of the megafauna, however, the increasingly homogeneous environment left them with shrinking geographical
        ranges – a death sentence for large animals, which need large ranges. Although these creatures managed to maintain
        viable populations through most of the Pleistocene, the final major fluctuation – the so-called Younger Dryas event
        – pushed them over the edge, Graham says. For his part, Alroy is convinced that human hunters demolished the titans
        of the Ice Age. The overkill model explains everything the disease and climate scenarios explain, he asserts, and
        makes accurate predictions about which species would eventually go extinct. “Personally, I’m a vegetarian,” he remarks,
        “and I find all of this kind of gross – but believable.”

        <h2><b>Stress of Workplace</b></h2><br>
      </div>
      <p>
        <b>A </b>&nbsp; How busy is too busy? For some it means having to miss the occasional long lunch; for others it means
        missing lunch altogether. For a few, it is not being able to take a “sickie” once a month. Then there is a group
        of people for whom working every evening and weekend is normal, and frantic is the tempo of their lives. For most
        senior executives, workloads swing between extremely busy and frenzied. The vice-president of the management consultancy
        AT Kearney and its head of telecommunications for the Asia-Pacific region, Neil Plumridge, says his work weeks vary
        from a “manageable” 45 hours to 80 hours, but average 60 hours.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>B </b>&nbsp; Three warning signs alert Plumridge about his workload: sleep, scheduling and family. He knows he
        has too much on when he gets less than six hours of sleep for three consecutive nights; when he is constantly having
        to reschedule appointments; “and the third one is on the family side”, says Plumridge, the father of a three-year-old
        daughter, and expecting a second child in October. “If I happen to miss a birthday or anniversary, I know things
        are out of control.” Being “too busy” is highly subjective. But for any individual, the perception of being too busy
        over a prolonged period can start showing up as stress: disturbed sleep, and declining mental and physical health.
        National workers’ compensation figures show stress causes the most lost time of any workplace injury. Employees suffering
        stress are off work an average of 16.6 weeks. The effects of stress are also expensive. Comcare, the Federal Government
        insurer, reports that in 2003-04, claims for psychological injury accounted for 7% of claims but almost 27% of claim
        costs. Experts say the key to dealing with stress is not to focus on relief – a game of golf or a massage – but to
        reassess workloads. Neil Plumridge says he makes it a priority to work out what has to change; that might mean allocating
        extra resources to a job, allowing more time or changing expectations. The decision may take several days. He also
        relies on the advice of colleagues, saying his peers coach each other with business problems. “Just a fresh pair
        of eyes over an issue can help,” he says.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>C </b>&nbsp; Executive stress is not confined to big organisations. Vanessa Stoykov has been running her own advertising
        and public relations business for seven years, specialising in work for financial and professional services firms.
        Evolution Media has grown so fast that it debuted on the BRW Fast 100 list of fastest-growing small enterprises last
        year – just after Stoykov had her first child. Stoykov thrives on the mental stimulation of running her own business.
        “Like everyone, I have the occasional day when I think my head’s going to blow off,” she says. Because of the growth
        phase the business is in, Stoykov has to concentrate on short-term stress relief – weekends in the mountains, the
        occasional “mental health” day – rather than delegating more work. She says: “We’re hiring more people, but you need
        to train them, teach them about the culture and the clients, so it’s actually more work rather than less.”
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>D </b>&nbsp; Identify the causes: Jan Elsnera, Melbourne psychologist who specialises in executive coaching, says
        thriving on a demanding workload is typical of senior executives and other high-potential business people. She says
        there is no one-size-fits-all approach to stress: some people work best with high-adrenalin periods followed by quieter
        patches, while others thrive under sustained pressure. “We could take urine and blood hormonal measures and pass
        a judgment of whether someone’s physiologically stressed or not,” she says. “But that’s not going to give us an indicator
        of what their experience of stress is, and what the emotional and cognitive impacts of stress are going to be.”
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>E </b>&nbsp; Eisner’s practice is informed by a movement known as positive psychology, a school of thought that
        argues “positive” experiences – feeling engaged, challenged, and that one is making a contribution to something meaningful
        – do not balance out negative ones such as stress; instead, they help people increase their resilience over time.
        Good stress, or positive experiences of being challenged and rewarded, is thus cumulative in the same way as bad
        stress. Elsner says many of the senior business people she coaches are relying more on regulating bad stress through
        methods such as meditation and yoga. She points to research showing that meditation can alter the biochemistry of
        the brain and actually help people “retrain” the way their brains and bodies react to stress. “Meditation and yoga
        enable you to shift the way that your brain reacts, so if you get proficient at it you’re in control.”
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>F </b>&nbsp; The Australian vice-president of AT Kearney, Neil Plumridge, says: “Often stress is caused by our
        setting unrealistic expectations of ourselves. I’ll promise a client I’ll do something tomorrow, and then promise
        another client the same thing, when I really know it’s not going to happen. I’ve put stress on myself when I could
        have said to the clients: ‘Why don’t I give that to you in 48 hours?’ The client doesn’t care.” Over-committing is
        something people experience as an individual problem. We explain it as the result of procrastination or Parkinson’s
        law: that work expands to fill the time available. New research indicates that people may be hard-wired to do it.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>G </b>&nbsp; A study in the February issue of the Journal of Experimental Psychology shows that people always
        believe they will be less busy in the future than now. This is a misapprehension, according to the authors of the
        report, Professor Gal Zauberman, of the University of North Carolina, and Professor John Lynch, of Duke University.
        “On average, an individual will be just as busy two weeks or a month from now as he or she is today. But that is
        not how it appears to be in everyday life,” they wrote. “People often make commitments long in advance that they
        would never make if the same commitments required immediate action. That is, they discount future time investments
        relatively steeply.” Why do we perceive a greater “surplus” of time in the future than in the present? The researchers
        suggest that people underestimate completion times for tasks stretching into the future, and that they are bad at
        imagining future competition for their time.

        <h2><b>Unexpected Benefits to Human Brain</b></h2><br>
      </div>
      <p>
        James Paul Gee, professor of education at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, played his first video game years ago when
        his six-year-old son Sam was playing Pajama Sam: No Need to Hide When It’s Dark Outside. He wanted to play the game
        so he could support Sam’s problem solving. Though Pajama Sam is not an “educational game”, it is replete with the
        types of problems psychologists study when they study thinking and learning. When he saw how well the game held Sam’s
        attention, he wondered what sort of beast a more mature video game might be.
        <br>
        <br> Video and computer games, like many other popular, entertaining and addicting kid’s activities, are looked down
        upon by many parents as time-wasters, and worse, parents think that these games rot the brain. Violent video games
        are readily blamed by the media and some experts as the reason why some youth become violent or commit extreme anti-social
        behavior. Recent content analyses of video games show that as many as 89% of games contain some violent content,
        but there is no form of aggressive content for 70% of popular games. Many scientists and psychologists, like James
        Paul Gee, find that video games actually have many benefits – the main one being making kids smart. Video games may
        actually teach kids high-level thinking skills that they will need in the future.
        <br>
        <br> “Video games change your brain,” according to University of Wisconsin psychologist Shawn Green. Video games
        change the brain’s physical structure the same way as do learning to read, playing the piano, or navigating using
        a map. Much like exercise can build muscle, the powerful combination of concentration and rewarding surges of neurotransmitters
        like dopamine, which strengthens neural circuits, can build the player’s brain.
        <br>
        <br> Video games give your child’s brain a real workout. In many video games, the skills required to win involve
        abstract and high level thinking. These skills are not even taught at school. Some of the mental skills trained by
        video games include: following instructions, problem solving, logic, hand-eye coordination, fine motor and spatial
        skills. Research also suggests that people can learn iconic, spatial, and visual attention skills from video games.
        There have been even studies with adults showing that experience with video games is related to better surgical skills.
        Jacob Benjamin, doctor from Beth Israel Medical Center NY, found a direct link between skill at video gaming and
        skill at keyhole or laparoscopic surgery. Also, a reason given by experts as to why fighter pilots of today are more
        skillful is that this generation’s pilots are being weaned on video games.
        <br>
        <br> The players learn to manage resources that are limited, and decide the best use of resources, the same way as
        in real life. In strategy games, for instance, while developing a city, an unexpected surprise like an enemy might
        emerge. This forces the player to be flexible and quickly change tactics. Sometimes the player does this almost every
        second of the game giving the brain a real workout. According to researchers at the University of Rochester, led
        by Daphne Bavelier, a cognitive scientist, games simulating stressful events such as those found in battle or action
        games could be a training tool for real-world situations. The study suggests that playing action video games primes
        the brain to make quick decisions. Video games can be used to train soldiers and surgeons, according to the study.
        Steven Johnson, author of Everything Bad is Good For You: How Today’s Popular Culture, says gamers must deal with
        immediate problems while keeping their long-term goals on their horizon. Young gamers force themselves to read to
        get instructions, follow storylines of games, and get information from the game texts.
        <br>
        <br> James Paul Gee, professor of education at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, says that playing a video game
        is similar to working through a science problem Like students in a laboratory, gamers must come up with a hypothesis.
        For example, players in some games constantly try out combinations of weapons and powers to use to defeat an enemy.
        If one does not work, they change hypothesis and try the next one. Video games are goal-driven experiences, says
        Gee, which are fundamental to learning. Also, using math skills is important to win in many games that involve quantitative
        analysis like managing resources. In higher levels of a game, players usually fail the first time around, but they
        keep on trying until they succeed and move on to the next level.
        <br>
        <br> Many games are played online and involve cooperation with other online players in order to win. Video and computer
        games also help children gain self-confidence and many games are based on history, city building, and governance
        and so on. Such games indirectly teach children about aspects of life on earth.
        <br>
        <br> In an upcoming study in the journal Current Biology, authors Daphne Bavelier, Alexandre Pouget, and C. Shawn
        Green report that video games could provide a potent training regimen for speeding up reactions in many types of
        real-life situations. The researchers tested dozens of 18- to 25-year-olds who were not ordinarily video game players.
        They split the subjects into two groups. One group played 50 hours of the fast-paced action video games “Call of
        Duty 2” and “Unreal Tournament,” and the other group played 50 hours of the slow-moving strategy game “The Sims 2.”
        After this training period, all of the subjects were asked to make quick decisions in several tasks designed by the
        researchers. The action game players were up to 25 percent faster at coming to a conclusion and answered just as
        many questions correctly as their strategy game playing peers.

        <h2><b>Foot Pedal Irrigation</b></h2><br>
      </div>
      <p>
        <b>A </b>&nbsp; Until now, governments and development agencies have tried to tackle the problem through large-scale
        projects: gigantic dams, sprawling, irrigation canals and vast new fields of high-yield crops introduced during the
        Green Revolution, the famous campaign to increase grain harvests in developing nations. Traditional irrigation, however,
        has degraded the soil in many areas, and the reservoirs behind dams can quickly fill up with silt, reducing their
        storage capacity and depriving downstream farmers of fertile sediments. Furthermore, although the Green Revolution
        has greatly expanded worldwide farm production since 1950, poverty stubbornly persists in Africa, Asia and Latin
        America. Continued improvements in the productivity of large farms may play the main role in boosting food supply,
        but local efforts to provide cheap, individual irrigation systems to small farms may offer a better way to lift people
        out of poverty.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>B </b>&nbsp; The Green Revolution was designed to increase the overall food supply, not to raise the incomes of
        the rural poor, so it should be no surprise that it did not eradicate poverty or hunger. India, for example, has
        been self-sufficient in food for 15 years, and its granaries are full, but more than 200 million Indians – one fifth
        of the country’s population – are malnourished because they cannot afford the food they need and because the country’s
        safety nets are deficient. In 2000, 189 nations committed to the Millennium Development Goals, which called for cutting
        world poverty in half by 2015. With business as usual, however, we have little hope of achieving most of the Millennium
        goals, no matter how much money rich countries contribute to poor ones.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>C </b>&nbsp; The supply-driven strategies of the Green Revolution, however, may not help subsistence farmers,
        who must play to their strengths to compete in the global marketplace. The average size of a family farm is less
        than four acres in India, 1.8 acres in Bangladesh and about half an acre in China. Combines and other modern farming
        tools are too expensive to be used on such small areas. An Indian farmer selling surplus wheat grown on his one-acre
        plot could not possibly compete with the highly efficient and subsidized Canadian wheat farms that typically stretch
        over thousands of acres. Instead subsistence farmers should exploit the fact that their labor costs are the lowest
        in the world, giving them a comparative advantage in growing and selling high-value, intensely farmed crops.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>D </b>&nbsp; Paul Polak saw firsthand the need for a small-scale strategy in 1981 when he met Abdul Rahman, a
        farmer in the Noakhali district of Bangladesh. From his three quarter-acre plots of rain-fed rice fields, Abdul could
        grow only 700 kilograms of rice each year – 300 kilograms less than what he needed to feed his family. During the
        three months before the October rice harvest came in, Abdul and his wife had to watch silently while their three
        children survived on one meal a day or less. As Polak walked with him through the scattered fields he had inherited
        from his father, Polak asked what he needed to move out of poverty. “Control of water for my crops,” he said, “at
        a price I can afford.”
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>E </b>&nbsp; Soon Polak learned about a simple device that could help Abdul achieve his goal: the treadle pump.
        Developed in the late 1970s by Norwegian engineer Gunnar Barnes, the pump is operated by a person walking in place
        on a pair of treadles and two handle arms made of bamboo. Properly adjusted and maintained, it can be operated several
        hours a day without tiring the users. Each treadle pump has two cylinders which are made of engineering plastic.
        The diameter of a cylinder is 100.5mm and the height is 280mm. The pump is capable of working up to a maximum depth
        of 7 meters. Operation beyond 7 meters is not recommended to preserve the integrity of the rubber components. The
        pump mechanism has piston and foot valve assemblies. The treadle action creates alternate strokes in the two pistons
        that lift the water in pulses.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>F </b>&nbsp; The human-powered pump can irrigate half an acre of vegetables and costs only $25 (including the
        expense of drilling a tube well down to the groundwater). Abdul heard about the treadle pump from a cousin and was
        one of the first farmers in Bangladesh to buy one. He borrowed the $25 from an uncle and easily repaid the loan four
        months later. During the five-month dry season, when Bangladeshis typically farm very little, Abdul used the treadle
        pump to grow a quarter-acre of chili peppers, tomatoes, cabbage and eggplants. He also improved the yield of one
        of his rice plots by irrigating it. His family ate some of the vegetables and sold the rest at the village market,
        earning a net profit of $100. With his new income, Abdul was able to buy rice for his family to eat, keep his two
        sons in school until they were 16 and set aside a little money for his daughter’s dowry. When Polak visited him again
        in 1984, he had doubled the size of his vegetable plot and replaced the thatched roof on his house with corrugated
        tin. His family was raising a calf and some chickens. He told me that the treadle pump was a gift from God.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>G </b>&nbsp; Bangladesh is particularly well suited for the treadle pump because a huge reservoir of groundwater
        lies just a few meters below the farmers’ feet. In the early 1980s IDE initiated a campaign to market the pump, encouraging
        75 small private-sector companies to manufacture the devices and several thousand village dealers and tube-well drillers
        to sell and install them. Over the next 12 years one and a half million farm families purchased treadle pumps, which
        increased the farmers’ net income by a total of $150 million a year. The cost of IDE’s market-creation activities
        was only $12 million, leveraged by the investment of $37.5 million from the farmers themselves. In contrast, the
        expense of building a conventional dam and canal system to irrigate an equivalent area of farmland would be in the
        range of $2,000 per acre, or $1.5 billion.

        <h2><b>Learning By Examples</b></h2><br>
      </div>
      <p>
        <b>A. </b>&nbsp; Learning theory is rooted in the work of Ivan Pavlov, the famous scientist who discover and documented
        the principles governing how animals (humans included) learn in the 1900s. Two basic kinds of learning or conditioning
        occur, one of which is famously known as the classical condition. Classical conditioning happens when an animal learns
        to associate a neutral stimulus (signal) with a stimulus that has intrinsic meaning based on how closely in time
        the two stimuli are presented. The classic example of classical conditioning is a dog’s ability to associate the
        sound of a bell (something that originally has no meaning to the dog) with the presentation of food (something that
        has a lot of meaning for the dog) a few moments later. Dogs are able to learn the association between bell and food,
        and will salivate immediately after hearing the bell once this connection has been made. Years of learning research
        have led to the creation of a highly precise learning theory that can be used to understand and predict how and under
        what circumstances most any animal will learn, including human beings, and eventually help people figure out how
        to change their behaviors.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>B </b>&nbsp; Role models are a popular notion for guiding child development, but in recent years very interesting
        research has been done on learning by example in other animals. If the subject of animal learning is taught very
        much in terms of classical or operant conditioning, it places too much emphasis on how we allow animals to learn
        and not enough on how they are equipped to learn. To teach a course of mine I have been dipping profitably into a
        very interesting and accessible compilation of papers on social learning in mammals, including chimps and human children,
        edited by Heyes and Galef.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>C </b>&nbsp; The research reported in one paper started with a school field trip to Israel to a pine forest where
        many pine cones were discovered, stripped to the central core. So the investigation started with no weighty theoretical
        intent, but was directed at finding out what was eating the nutritious pine seeds and how they managed to get them
        out of the cones. The culprit proved to be the versatile and athletic black rat (Rattus) and the technique was to
        bite each cone scale off at its base, in sequence from base to tip following the spiral growth pattern of the cone.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>D </b>&nbsp; Urban black rats were found to lack the skill and were unable to learn it even if housed with experiences
        cone strippers. However, infants of urban mothers cross fostered to stripper mothers acquired the skill, whereas
        infants of stripper mothers fostered by an urban mother could not. Clearly the skill had to be learned from the mother.
        Further elegant experiments showed that naive adults could develop the skill if they were provided with cones from
        which the first complete spiral of scales had been removed, rather like our new photocopier which you can word out
        how to use once someone has shown you how to switch it on. In case of rats, the youngsters take cones away from the
        mother when she is still feeding on them, allowing them to acquire the complete stripping skill.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>E </b>&nbsp; A good example of adaptive bearing we might conclude, but let’s see the economies. This was determined
        by measuring oxygen uptake of a rat stripping a cone in a metabolic chamber to calculate energetic cost and comparing
        it with the benefit of the pine seeds measured by calorimeter. The cost proved to be less than 10% of the energetic
        value of the cone. An acceptable profit margin.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>F </b>&nbsp; A paper in 1996 Animal Behavior by Bednekoff and Balda provides a different view of the adaptiveness
        of social learning. It concerns the seed catching behavior of Clark’s nutcracker (Nucifraga Columbiana) and the Mexican
        jay (Aphelocoma ultramarine). The former is a specialist, catching 30,000 or so seeds in scattered locations that
        it will recover over the months of winter, the Mexican jay will also cache food but is much less dependent upon this
        than the nutcracker. The two species also differ in their social structure, the nutcracker being rather solitary
        while the jay forages in social groups.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>G </b>&nbsp; The experiment is to discover not just whether a bird can remember where it hid a seed but also if
        it can remember where it saw another bird hide a seed. The design is slightly comical with a cacher bird wandering
        about a room with lots of holes in the floor hiding food in some of the holes, while watched by an observer bird
        perched in a cage. Two days later cachers and observers are tested for their discovery rate against an estimated
        random performance. In the role of cacher, not only nutcracker but also the less specialized jay performed above
        chance; more surprisingly, however, jay observers were as successful as jay cachers whereas nutcracker observers
        did no better than chance. It seems that, whereas the nutcracker is highly adapted at remembering where it hid its
        own seeds, the social living Mexican jay is more adept at remembering, and so exploiting, the caches of others.

        <h2><b>Eco-Resort Management</b></h2><br>
      </div>
      <p>
          <b>A </b>&nbsp;    Ecotourism is often regarded as a form of nature-based tourism and has become an important alternative source of tourists. In addition to providing the traditional resort-leisure product, it has been argued that ecotourism resort management should have a particular focus on best-practice environmental management, an educational and interpretive component, and direct and indirect contributions to the conservation of the natural and cultural environment (Ayala, 1996).
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>B </b>&nbsp;   Couran Cove Island Resort is a large integrated ecotourism-based resort located south of Brisbane on the Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia. As the world’s population becomes increasingly urbanised, the demand for tourist attractions which are environmentally friendly, serene and offer amenities of a unique nature, has grown rapidly. Couran Cove Resort, which is one such tourist attractions, is located on South Stradbroke Island, occupying approximately 150 hectares of the island. South Stradbroke Island is separated from the mainland by the Broadwater, a stretch of sea 3 kilometers wide. More than a century ago, there was only one Stradbroke Island, and there were at least four aboriginal tribes living and hunting on the island. Regrettably, most of the original island dwellers were eventually killed by diseases such as tuberculosis, smallpox and influenza by the end of the 19th The second ship wreak on the island in 1894, and the subsequent destruction of the ship (the Cambus Wallace) because it contained dynamite, caused a large crater in the sandhills on Stradbroke Island. Eventually, the ocean broke through the weakened land form and Stradbroke became two islands. Couran Cove Island Resort is built on one of the world’s few naturally-occurring sand lands, which is home to a wide range of plant communities and one of the largest remaining remnants of the rare livistona rainforest left on the Gold Coast. Many mangrove and rainforest areas, and Malaleuca Wetlands on South Stradbroke Island (and in Queensland), have been cleared, drained or filled for residential, industrial, agricultural or urban development in the first half of the 20th century. Farmer and graziers finally abandoned South Stradbroke Island in 1939 because the vegetation and the soil conditions there were not suitable for agricultural activities.
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>SUSTAINABLE PRACTICES OF COURAN COVE RESORT</b>
          <br>
          <br>
          Being located on an offshore island, the resort is only accessible by means of water transportation. The resort provides hourly ferry service from the marina on the mainland to and from the island. Within the resort, transport modes include walking trails, bicycle tracks and the beach train. The reception area is the counter of the shop which has not changed in 8 years at least. The accommodation is an octagonal “Bure”. These are large rooms that are clean but! The equipment is tired and in some cases just working. Our ceiling fan only worked on high speed for example. Beds are hard but clean, there is television, radio, an old air conditioner and a small fridge. These “Bures” are right on top of each other and night noises do carry so be careful what you say and do. The only thing is the mosquitos but if you forget to bring mosquito repellant they sell some on the island.
          <br>
          <br>
          As an ecotourism-based resort, most of the planning and development of the attraction has been concentrated on the need to co-exist with the fragile natural environment of South Stradbroke Island to achieve sustainable development.
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>WATER AND ENERGY MANAGEMENT</b>
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>C </b>&nbsp; South Stradbroke Island has groundwater at the centre of the island, which has a maximum height of 3 metres above sea level. The water supply is recharged by rainfall and is commonly known as an unconfined freshwater aquifer. Couran Cove Island Resort obtains its water supply by tapping into this aquifer and extracting it via a bore system. Some of the problems which have threatened the island’s freshwater supply include pollution, contamination and over-consumption. In order to minimise some of these problems, all laundry activities are carried out on the mainland. The resort considers washing machines as onerous to the island’s freshwater supply, and that the detergents contain a high level of phosphates which are a major source of water pollution. The resort uses LPG-power generation rather than a diesel-powered plant for its energy supply, supplemented by wind turbine, which has reduced greenhouse emissions by 70% of diesel-equivalent generation methods. Excess heat recovered from the generator is used to heat the swimming pool. Hot water in the eco-cabins and for some of the resort’s vehicles are solar-powered. Water efficient fittings are also installed in showers and toilets. However, not all the appliances used by the resort are energy efficient, such as refrigerators. Visitors who stay at the resort are encouraged to monitor their water and energy usage via the in-house television system, and are rewarded with prizes (such as a free return trip to the resort) accordingly if their usage level is low.
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>CONCLUDING REMARKS</b>
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>D </b>&nbsp; We examined a case study of good management practice and a pro-active sustainable tourism stance of an eco-resort. In three years of operation, Couran Cove Island Resort has won 23 international and national awards, including the 2001 Australian Tourism Award in the 4-Star Accommodation category. The resort has embraced and has effectively implemented contemporary environmental management practices. It has been argued that the successful implementation of the principles of sustainability should promote long-term social, economic and environmental benefits, while ensuring and enhancing the prospects of continued viability for the tourism enterprise. Couran Cove Island Resort does not conform to the characteristics of the ResortDevelopmentSpectrum, as proposed by Prideaux (2000). According to Prideaux, the resort should be at least at Phase 3 of the model (the National tourism phase), which describes an integrated resort providing 3-4 star hotel-type accommodation. The primary tourist market in Phase 3 of the model consists mainly of interstate visitors. However, the number of interstate and international tourists visiting the resort is small, with the principal visitor markets comprising locals and residents from nearby towns and the Gold Coast region. The carrying capacity of Couran Cove does not seem to be of any concern to the Resort management. Given that it is a private commercial ecotourist enterprise, regulating the number of visitors to the resort to minimize damage done to the natural environment on South Stradbroke Island is not a binding constraint. However, the Resort’s growth will eventually be constrained by its carrying capacity, and quantity control should be incorporated in the management strategy of the resort.

        <h2><b>Keep a Watchful Eye on the Bridges</b></h2><br>
      </div>
      <p>
          <b>A </b>&nbsp;     Most road and rail bridges are only inspected visually, if at all. Every few months, engineers have to clamber over the structure in an attempt to find problems before the bridge shows obvious signs of damage. Technologies developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory, New Mexico, and Texas A&M University may replace these surveys with microwave sensors that constantly monitor the condition of bridges.
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>B </b>&nbsp;    “The device uses microwaves to measure the distance between the sensor and the bridge, much like radar does,” says Albert Migliori, a Los Alamos physicist “Any load on the bridge – such as traffic induces displacements, which change that distance as the bridge moves up and down.” By monitoring these movements over several minutes, the researchers can find out how the bridge resonates. Changes in its behaviour can give an early warning of damage.
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>C </b>&nbsp;   The Interstate 40 bridge over the Rio Grande river in Albuquerque provided the researchers with a rare opportunity to text their ideas. Chuck Farrar, an engineer at Los Alamos, explains: “The New Mexico authorities decided to raze this bridge and replace it. We were able to mount instruments on it, test it under various load conditions and even inflict damage just before it was demolished.” In the 1960s and 1970s, 2500 similar bridges were built in the US. They have two steel girders supporting the load in each section. Highway experts know that this design is “fracture critical” because a failure in either girder would cause the bridge to fail.
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>D </b>&nbsp;   After setting up the microwave dish on the ground below the bridge, the Los Alamos team installed conventional accelerometers at several points along the span to measure its motion. They then tested the bridge while traffic roared across it and while subjecting it to pounding from a “shaker”, which delivered precise punches to a specific point on the road.
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>E </b>&nbsp;   “We then created damage that we hoped would simulate fatigue cracks that can occur in steel girders,” says Farrar. They first cut a slot about 60 centimetres long in the middle of one girder. They then extended the cut until it reached the bottom of the girder and finally they cut across the flange – the bottom of the girder’s “I” shape.
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>F </b>&nbsp;   The initial, crude analysis of the bridge’s behaviour, based on the frequency at which the bridge resonates, did not indicate that anything was wrong until the flange was damaged. But later the data were reanalysed with algorithms that took into account changes in the mode shapes of the structure – shapes that the structure takes on when excited at a particular frequency. These more sophisticated algorithms, which were developed by Norris Stubbs at Texas A&M University, successfully identified and located the damage caused by the initial cut.
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>G </b>&nbsp;   “When any structure vibrates, the energy is distributed throughout with some points not moving, while others vibrate strongly at various frequencies,” says Stubbs. “My algorithms use pattern recognition to detect changes in the distribution of this energy.” NASA already uses Stubbs’ method to check the behaviour of the body flap that slows space shuttles down after they land.
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>H </b>&nbsp;   A commercial system based on the Los Alamos hardware is now available, complete with the Stubbs algorithms, from the Quatro Corporation in Albuquerque for about $100,000. Tim Darling, another Los Alamos physicist working on the microwave interferometer with Migliori, says that as the electronics become cheaper, a microwave inspection system will eventually be applied to most large bridges in the US. “In a decade I would like to see a battery or solar-powered package mounted under each bridge, scanning it every day to detect changes,” he says.

        <h2><b>Activities for Children</b></h2><br>
      </div>
      <p>
          <b>A </b>&nbsp;   Twenty-five years ago, children in London walked to school and played in parks and playing fields after school and at the weekend. Today they are usually driven to school by parents anxious about safety and spend hours glued to television screens or computer games. Meanwhile, community playing fields are being sold off to property developers at an alarming rate. ‘This change in lifestyle has, sadly, meant greater restrictions on children,’ says Neil Armstrong, Professor of Health and Exercise Science at the University of Exeter. ‘If children continue to be this inactive, they’ll be storing up big problems for the future.’
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>B </b>&nbsp;   In 1985, Professor Armstrong headed a five-year research project into children’s fitness. The results, published in 1990, were alarming. The survey, which monitored 700 11-16-year-olds, found that 48 per cent of girls and 41 per cent of boys already exceeded safe cholesterol levels set for children by the American Heart Foundation. Armstrong adds, “heart is a muscle and need exercise, or it loses its strength.” It also found that 13 per cent of boys and 10 per cent of girls were overweight. More disturbingly, the survey found that over a four-day period, half the girls and one-third of the boys did less exercise than the equivalent of a brisk 10-minute walk. High levels of cholesterol, excess body fat and inactivity are believed to increase the risk of coronary heart disease.
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>C </b>&nbsp;   Physical education is under pressure in the UK – most schools devote little more than 100 minutes a week to it in curriculum time, which is less than many other European countries. Three European countries are giving children a head start in PE, France, Austria and Switzerland – offer at least two hours in primary and secondary schools. These findings, from the European Union of Physical Education Associations, prompted specialists in children’s physiology to call on European governments to give youngsters a daily PE programme. The survey shows that the UK ranks 13th out of the 25 countries, with Ireland bottom, averaging under an hour a week for PE. From age six to 18, British children received, on average, 106 minutes of PE a week. Professor Armstrong, who presented the findings at the meeting, noted that since the introduction of the national curriculum there had been a marked fall in the time devoted to PE in UK schools, with only a minority of pupils getting two hours a week.
          <br>

          <b>D </b>&nbsp;   As a former junior football international, Professor Armstrong is a passionate advocate for sport. Although the Government has poured millions into beefing up sport in the community, there is less commitment to it as part of the crammed school curriculum. This means that many children never acquire the necessary skills to thrive in team games. If they are no good at them, they lose interest and establish an inactive pattern of behaviour. When this is coupled with a poor diet, it will lead inevitably to weight gain. Seventy per cent of British children give up all sport when they leave school, compared with only 20 per cent of French teenagers. Professor Armstrong believes that there is far too great an emphasis on team games at school. “We need to look at the time devoted to PE and balance it between individual and pair activities, such as aerobics and badminton, as well as team sports.” He added that children need to have the opportunity to take part in a wide variety of individual, partner and team sports.

          <br>
          <b>E </b>&nbsp;    The good news, however, is that a few small companies and children’s activity groups have reacted positively and creatively to the problem. ‘Take That,’ shouts Gloria Thomas, striking a disco pose astride her mini-space hopper. ‘Take That,’ echo a flock of toddlers, adopting outrageous postures astride their space hoppers. ‘Michael Jackson,’ she shouts, and they all do a spoof fan-crazed shriek. During the wild and chaotic hopper race across the studio floor, commands like this are issued and responded to with untrammelled glee. The sight of 15 bouncing seven-year-olds who seem about to launch into orbit at every bounce brings tears to the eyes. Uncoordinated, loud, excited and emotional, children provide raw comedy.

          <b>F </b>&nbsp;    Any cardiovascular exercise is a good option, and it doesn’t necessarily have to be high intensity. It can be anything that gets your heart rate up: such as walking the dog, swimming, running skipping, hiking. “Even walking through the grocery store can be exercise,” Samis-Smith said. What they don’t know is that they’re at a Fit Kids class, and that the fun is a disguise for the serious exercise plan they’re covertly being taken through. Fit Kids trains parents to run fitness classes for children. ‘Ninety per cent of children don’t like team sports,’ says company director, Gillian Gale.

          <b>G </b>&nbsp;   A Prevention survey found that children whose parents keep in shape are much more likely to have healthy body weights themselves. “There’s nothing worse than telling a child what he needs to do and not doing it yourself,” says Elizabeth Ward, R.D., a Boston nutritional consultant and author of Healthy Foods, Healthy Kids. “Set a good example and get your nutritional house in order first.” In the 1930s and ’40s, kids expended 800 calories a day just walking, carrying water, and doing other chores,’ notes Fima Lifshitz, M.D., a pediatric endocrinologist in Santa Barbara. “Now, kids in obese families are expending only 200 calories a day in physical activity,” says Lifshitz, “incorporate more movement in your family’s life – park farther away from the stores at the mall, take stairs instead of the elevator, and walk to nearby friends’ houses instead of driving.”

        <h2><b>Roller coaster</b></h2><br>
      </div>
      <p>
          <b>A </b>&nbsp;     600 years ago, roller coaster pioneers never would have imagined the advancements that have been made to create the roller coasters of today. The tallest and fastest roller coaster in the world is the Kingda Ka, a coaster in New Jersey that launches its passengers from zero to 128 miles per hour in 3.5 seconds (most sports cars take over four seconds to get to just 60 miles per hour). It then heaves its riders skyward at a 90-degree angle (straight up) until it reaches a height of 456 feet, over one and a half football fields, above the ground, before dropping another 418 feet (Coaster Grotto “Kingda Ka”). With that said, roller coasters are about more than just speed and height, they are about the creativity of the designers that build them, each coaster having its own unique way of producing intense thrills at a lesser risk than the average car ride. Roller coasters have evolved drastically over the years, from their primitive beginnings as Russian ice slides, to the metal monsters of today. Their combination of creativity and structural elements make them one of the purest forms of architecture.
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>B </b>&nbsp;    At first glance, a roller coaster is something like a passenger train. It consists of a series of connected cars that move on tracks. But unlike a passenger train, a roller coaster has no engine or power source of its own. For most of the ride, the train is moved by gravity and momentum. To build up this momentum, you need to get the train to the top of the first hill or give it a powerful launch. The traditional lifting mechanism is a long length of chain running up the hill under the track. The chain is fastened in a loop, which is wound around a gear at the top of the hill and another one at the bottom of the hill. The gear at the bottom of the hill is turned by a simple motor. This turns the chain loop so that it continually moves up the hill like a long conveyer belt. The coaster cars grip onto the chain with several chain dogs, sturdy hinged hooks. When the train rolls to the bottom of the hill, the dogs catches onto the chain links. Once the chain dog is hooked, the chain simply pulls the train to the top of the hill. At the summit, the chain dog is released and the train starts its descent down the hill.
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>C </b>&nbsp;   Roller coasters have a long, fascinating history. The direct ancestors of roller coasters were monumental ice slides – long, steep wooden-slides covered in ice, some as high as 70 feet – that were popular in Russia in the 16th and 17th centuries. Riders shot down the slope in sleds made out of wood or blocks of ice, crash-landing in a sand pile. Coaster historians diverge on the exact evolution of these ice slides into actual rolling carts. The most widespread account is that a few entrepreneurial Frenchmen imported the ice slide idea to France. The warmer climate of France tended to melt the ice, so the French started building waxed slides instead, eventually adding wheels to the sleds. In 1817, the Russes a Belleville (Russian Mountains of Belleville) became the first roller coaster where the train was attached to the track (in this case, the train axle fit into a carved groove). The French continued to expand on this idea, coming up with more complex track layouts, with multiple cars and all sorts of twists and turns.
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>D </b>&nbsp;    In comparison to the world’s first roller coaster, there is perhaps an even greater debate over what was America’s first true coaster. Many will say that it is Pennsylvania’s own Maunch Chunk-Summit Hill and Switch  Back  Railroad.  The  Maunch   Chunk-Summit  Hill  and  Switch  Back  Railroad  was   originally America’s second railroad, and considered my many to be the greatest coaster of all time. Located in the Lehigh valley, it was originally used to transport coal from the top of Mount Pisgah to the bottom of Mount Jefferson, until Josiah White, a mining entrepreneur, had the idea of turning it into a part-time thrill ride. Because of its immediate popularity, it soon became strictly a passenger train. A steam engine would haul passengers to the top of the mountain, before letting them coast back down, with speeds rumored to reach 100 miles per hour! The reason that it was called a switch back railroad, a switch back track was located at the top – where the steam engine would let the riders coast back down. This type of track featured a dead end where the steam engine would detach its cars, allowing riders to coast down backwards. The railway went through a couple of minor track changes and name changes over the years, but managed to last from 1829 to 1937, over 100 years.
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>E </b>&nbsp;    The coaster craze in America was just starting to build. The creation of the Switch Back Railway, by La Marcus Thompson, gave roller coasters national attention. Originally built at New York’s Coney Island in 1884, Switch Back Railways began popping up all over the country. The popularity of these rides may puzzle the modern-day thrill seeker, due to the mild ride they gave in comparison to the modern-day roller coaster. Guests would pay a nickel to wait in line up to five hours just to go down a pair of side-by-side tracks with gradual hills that vehicles coasted down at a top speed around six miles per hour. Regardless, Switchback Railways were very popular, and sparked many people, including Thompson, to design coasters that were bigger and better.
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>F </b>&nbsp;    The 1910s and 1920s were probably the best decade that the roller coaster has ever seen. The new wave of technology, such as the “unstop wheels”, an arrangement that kept a coaster’s wheels to its tracks by resisted high gravitational forces, showed coasters a realm of possibilities that has never been seen before. In 1919, North America alone had about 1,500 roller coasters, a number that was rising rampantly. Then, the Great Depression gave a crushing blow to amusement parks all over America. As bad as it was, amusement parks had an optimistic look on the future in the late 1930s. But, in 1942 roller coasters could already feel the effects of World War Two, as they were forced into a shadow of neglect. Most, nearly all of America’s roller coasters were shut down. To this very day, the number of roller coaster in America is just a very tiny fraction of the amount of roller coasters in the 1920s.

        <h2><b>Animal Minds: Parrot Alex</b></h2><br>
      </div>
      <p>

        <b>A </b>&nbsp;  In 1977 Irene Pepperberg, a recent graduate of Harvard University, did something very bold. At a time when animals still were considered automatons, she set out to find what was on another creature’s mind by talking to it. She brought a one-year-old African gray parrot she named Alex into her lab to teach him to reproduce the sounds of the English language. “I thought if he learned to communicate, I could ask him questions about how he sees the world.”
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>B </b>&nbsp;   When Pepperberg began her dialogue with Alex, who died last September at the age of 31, many scientists believed animals were incapable of any thought. They were simply machines, robots programmed to react to stimuli but lacking the ability to think or feel.Any pet owner would disagree. We see the love in our dogs’ eyes and know that, of course, they has thoughts and emotions. But such claims remain highly controversial. Gut instinct is not science, and it is all too easy to project human thoughts and feelings onto another creature. How, then, does a scientist prove that an animal is capable of thinking – that it is able to acquire information about the world and act on it? “That’s why I started my studies withAlex,” Pepperberg said. They were seated – she at her desk, he on top of his cage – in her lab, a windowless room about the size of a boxcar, at Brandeis University. Newspapers lined the floor; baskets of bright toys were stacked on the shelves. They were clearly a team – and because of their work, the notion that animals can think is no longer so fanciful.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>C </b>&nbsp;   Certain skills are considered key signs of higher mental abilities: good memory, a grasp of grammar and symbols, self-awareness, understanding others’ motives, imitating others, and being creative. Bit by bit, in ingenious experiments, researchers have documented these talents in other species, gradually chipping away at what we thought made human beings distinctive while offering a glimpse of where our own abilities came from. Scrub jays know that other jays are thieves and that stashed food can spoil; sheep can recognize faces; chimpanzees use a variety of tools to probe termite mounds and even use weapons to hunt small mammals; dolphins can imitate human postures; the archerfish, which stuns insects with a sudden blast of water, can learn how to aim its squirt simply by watching an experienced fish perform the task.AndAlex the parrot turned out to be a surprisingly good talker.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>D </b>&nbsp;   Thirty years after the Alex studies began; Pepperberg and a changing collection of assistants were still giving him English lessons. The humans, along with two younger parrots, also served as Alex’s flock, providing the social input all parrots crave. Like any flock, this one – as small as it was – had its share of drama. Alex dominated his fellow parrots, acted huffy at times around Pepperberg, tolerated the other female humans, and fell to pieces over a male assistant who dropped by for a visit. Pepperberg bought Alex in a Chicago pet store where she let the store’s assistant pick him out because she didn’t want other scientists saying later that she’d particularly chosen an especially smart bird for her work. Given that Alex’s brain was the size of a shelled walnut, most researchers thought Pepperberg’s interspecies communication study would be futile.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>E </b>&nbsp;   “Some people actually called me crazy for trying this,” she said. “Scientists thought that chimpanzees were better subjects, although, of course, chimps can’t speak.” Chimpanzees, bonobos, and gorillas have been taught to use sign language and symbols to communicate with us, often with impressive results. The bonobo Kanzi, for instance, carries his symbol-communication board with him so he can “talk” to his human researchers, and he has invented combinations of symbols to express his thoughts. Nevertheless, this is not the same thing as having an animal look up at you, open his mouth, and speak. Under Pepperberg’s patient tutelage, Alex learned how to use his vocal tract to imitate almost one hundred English words, including the sounds for various foods, although he calls an apple a “beanery.” “Apples taste a little bit like bananas to him, and they look a little bit like cherries, Alex made up that word for them,” Pepperberg said.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>F </b>&nbsp;   It sounded a bit mad, the idea of a bird having lessons to practice, and willingly doing it. But after listening to and observing Alex, it was difficult to argue with Pepperberg’s explanation for his behaviors. She wasn’t handing him treats for the repetitious work or rapping him on the claws to make him say the sounds. “He has to hear the words over and over before he can correctly imitate them,” Pepperberg said, after pronouncing “seven” for Alex a good dozen times in a row. “I’m not trying to see if Alex can learn a human language,” she added. “That’s never been the point. My plan always was to use his imitative skills to get a better understanding of avian cognition.”
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>G </b>&nbsp;   In other words, because Alex was able to produce a close approximation of the sounds of some English words, Pepperberg could ask him questions about a bird’s basic understanding of the world. She couldn’t ask him what he was thinking about, but she could ask him about his knowledge of numbers, shapes, and colors. To demonstrate, Pepperberg carried Alex on her arm to a tall wooden perch in the middle of the room. She then retrieved a green key and a small green cup from a basket on a shelf. She held up the two items to Alex’s eye. “What’s same?” she asked. Without hesitation, Alex’s beak opened: “Co-lor.” “What’s different?” Pepperberg asked. “Shape,” Alex said. His voice had the digitized sound of a cartoon character. Since parrots lack lips (another reason it was difficult for Alex to pronounce some sounds, such as ba), the words seemed to come from the air around him, as if a ventriloquist were speaking. But the words – and what can only be called the thoughts – were entirely his.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>H </b>&nbsp;   For the next 20 minutes, Alex ran through his tests, distinguishing colors, shapes, sizes, and materials (wool versus wood versus metal). He did some simple arithmetic, such as counting the yellow toy blocks among a pile of mixed hues. And, then, as if to offer final proof of the mind inside his bird’s brain, Alex spoke up. “Talk clearly!” he commanded, when one of the younger birds Pepperberg was also teaching talked with wrong pronunciation. “Talk clearly!” “Don’t be a smart aleck,” Pepperberg said, shaking her head at him. “He knows all this, and he gets bored, so he interrupts the others, or he gives the wrong answer just to be obstinate. At this stage, he’s like a teenager; he’s moody, and I’m never sure what he’ll do.”

        <h2><b>Developing Courtiers</b></h2><br>
      </div>
      <p>

        <b>A. </b>&nbsp;   The Ecotourism Society defines ecotourism as “a responsible travel to natural areas which conserves the environment and improves the welfare of local people”. It is recognised as being particularly conducive to enriching and enhancing the standing of tourism, on the basis that this form of tourism respects the natural heritage and local populations and are in keeping with the carrying capacity of the sites.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>B. </b>&nbsp;  Cuba is undoubtedly an obvious site for ecotourism, with its picturesque beaches, underwater beauty, countryside landscapes, and ecological reserves. An educated population and improved infrastructure of roads and communications adds to the mix. In the Caribbean region, Cuba is now the second most popular tourist destination. Ecotourism is also seen as an environmental education opportunity to heighten both visitors’ and residents’ awareness of environmental and conservation issues, and even to inspire conservation action. Ecotourism has also been credited with promoting peace, by providing opportunities for educational and cultural exchange. Tourists’ safety and health are guaranteed. Raul Castro, brother of the Cuban president, started this initiative to rescue the Cuban tradition of herbal medicine and provide natural medicines for its healthcare system. The school at Las Terrazas Eco-Tourism Community teaches herbal healthcare and children learn not only how to use medicinal herbs, but also to grow them in the school garden for teas, tinctures, ointments and creams. In Cuba, ecotourism has the potential to alleviate poverty by bringing money into the economy and creating jobs. In addition to the environmental impacts of these efforts, the area works on developing community employment opportunities for locals, in conjunction with ecotourism.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>C. </b>&nbsp;   In terms of South America, it might be the place which shows the shortcoming of ecotourism. Histoplasma capsulatum, a dimorphic fungus, is the most common endemic mycosis in the United States, and is associated with exposure to bat or bird droppings. Most recently, outbreaks have been reported in healthy travelers who returned from Central and South America after engaging in recreational activities associated with spelunking, adventure tourism, and ecotourism. It is quite often to see tourists neglected sanitation while travelling. After engaging in high-risk activities, boots should be hosed off and clothing placed in airtight plastic bags for laundering. HIV-infected travelers should avoid risky behaviors or environments, such as exploring caves, particularly those that contain bat droppings.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>D. </b>&nbsp;   Nowhere is the keen eye and intimate knowledge of ecotourism is more amidst this fantastic biodiversity, as we explore remote realms rich in wildlife rather than a nature adventure. A sustainable tour is significant for ecotourism, one in which we can grow hand in hand with nature and our community, respecting everything that makes us privileged. Travelers get great joy from every step that take forward on this endless but exciting journey towards sustainability. The primary threats to South America’s tropical forests are deforestation caused by agricultural expansion, cattle ranching, fagging, oil extraction and spills, mining, illegal coca farming, and colonization initiatives. Deforestation has shrunk territories belonging to indigenous peoples and wiped out more than 90% of the population. Many are taking leading roles in sustainable tourism even as they introduce protected regions to more travelers.

        <b>E. </b>&nbsp;   In East Africa, significantly reducing such illegal hunting and allowing wildlife populations to recover would allow the generation of significant economic benefits through trophy hunting and potentially ecotourism. “Illegal hunting is an extremely inefficient use of wildlife resources because it fails to capture the value of wildlife achievable through alternative forms of use such as trophy hunting and ecotourism,” said Peter Lindsey, author of the new study. Most residents believed that ecotourism could solve this circumstance. They have passion for local community empowerment, loves photography and writes to laud current local conservation efforts, create environmental awareness and promote ecotourism.

        <b>F. </b>&nbsp;   In Indonesia, ecotourism started to become an important concept from 1995, in order to strengthen the domestic travelling movement, the local government targeting the right markets is a prerequisite for successful ecotourism. The market segment for Indonesian ecotourism consists of: (i) “The silent generation”, 55-64 year-old people who are wealthy enough, generally well-educated and have no dependent children, and can travel for four weeks; (ii) “The baby boom generation”, junior successful executives aged 35-54 years, who are likely to be travelling with their family and children (spending 2-3 weeks on travel) – travelling for them is a stress reliever; and (iii) the “X generation”, aged 18-29 years, who love to do ecotours as backpackers – they are generally students who can travel for 3-12 months with monthly expenditure of US$300-500. It is suggested that promotion of Indonesian ecotourism products should aim to reach these various cohorts of tourists. The country welcomes diverse levels of travelers.

        <b>G. </b>&nbsp;   On the other hand, ecotourism provide as many services as traditional tourism. Nestled between Mexico, Guatemala and the Caribbean Sea is the country of Belize. It is the wonderful place for Hamanasi honeymoon, bottle of champagne upon arrival, three meals daily, a private service on one night of your stay and a choice of adventures depending on the length of your stay. It also offers six-night and seven-night honeymoon packages. A variety of specially tailored tours, including the Brimstone Hill Fortress, and a trip to a neighboring island. Guided tours include rainforest, volcano and off-road plantation tours. Gregory Pereira, an extremely knowledgeable and outgoing hiking and tour guide, says the following about his tours: “All of our tours on St. Kitts include transportation by specially modified Land Rovers, a picnic of island pastries and local fruit, fresh tropical juices, CSR, a qualified island guide and a full liability insurance coverage for participants.

        <b>H. </b>&nbsp;   Kodai is an ultimate splendor spot for those who love being close to mother nature. They say every bird must sing its own throat while we say every traveller should find his own way out of variegated and unblemished paths of deep valleys and steep mountains. The cheese factory here exports great quantity of cheese to various countries across the globe. It is located in the center of forest. Many travelers are attracted by the delicious cheese. The ecotourism is very famous of this different eating experience.

        <h2><b>Ancient Societies Classification</b></h2><br>
      </div>
      <p>

        <b>A. </b>&nbsp;   Although humans have established many types of societies throughout history sociologists and anthropologists tend to classify different societies according to the degree to which different groups within a society have unequal access to advantages such as resources, prestige or power, and usually refer to four basic types of societies. From least to most socially complex, they are: clans, tribes, chiefdoms and states.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Clan</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>B. </b>&nbsp;    These are small-scale societies of hunters and gatherers, generally of fewer than 100 people, who move seasonally to exploit wild (undomesticated) food resources. Most surviving hunter – gatherer groups are of this kind, such as the Hadza of Tanzania or the San of southern Africa. Clan members are generally kinsfolk, related by descent or marriage. Clans lack formal leaders, so there are no marked economic differences or disparities in status among their members.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>C. </b>&nbsp;   Because clans are composed of mobile groups of hunter-gatherers, their sites consist mainly of seasonally occupied camps, and other smaller and more specialised sites. Among the latter are kill or butchery sites – locations where large mammals are killed and sometimes butchered – and work sites, where tools are made or other specific activities carried out. The base camp of such a group may give evidence of rather insubstantial dwellings or temporary shelters, along with the debris of residential occupation.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Tribe</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>D. </b>&nbsp;   These are generally larger than mobile hunter – gatherer groups, but rarely number more than a few thousand, and their diet or subsistence is based largely on cultivated plants and domesticated animals. Typically, they are settled farmers, but they may be nomadic with a very different, mobile economy based on the intensive exploitation of livestock. These are generally multi-community societies, with the individual communities integrated into the large society through kinship ties. Although some tribes have officials and even a “capital” or seat of government, such officials lack the economic base necessary for effective use of power.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>E. </b>&nbsp;   The typical settlement pattern for tribes is one of settled agricultural homesteads or villages. Characteristically, no one settlement dominates any of the others in the region. Instead, the archaeologist finds evidence for isolated, permanently occupied houses or for permanent villages. Such villages may be made up of a collection of free-standing houses, like those of the first farms of the Danube valley in Europe. Or they may be clusters of buildings grouped together, for example, the pueblos of the American Southwest, and the early farming village or small town of Catalhoyuk in modern Turkey.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Chiefdom</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>F. </b>&nbsp;   These operate on the principle of ranking-differences in social status between people. Different lineages (a lineage is a group claiming descent from a common ancestor) are graded on a scale of prestige, and the senior lineage, and hence the society as a whole, is governed by a chief. Prestige and rank are determined by how closely related one is to the chief, and there is no true stratification into classes. The role of the chief is crucial.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>G. </b>&nbsp;   Often, there is local specialisation in craft products, and surpluses of these and of foodstuffs are periodically paid as obligation to the chief. He uses these to maintain his retainers, and may use them for redistribution to his subjects. The chiefdom generally has a center of power, often with temples, residences of the chief and his retainers, and craft specialists. Chiefdoms vary greatly in size, but the range is generally between about 5000 and 20,000 persons.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Early State</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>H. </b>&nbsp;   These preserve many of the features of chiefdoms, but the ruler (perhaps a king or sometimes a queen) has explicit authority to establish laws and also to enforce them by the use of a standing army. Society no longer depends totally upon kin relationships: it is now stratified into different classes. Agricultural workers and the poorer urban dwellers form the lowest classes, with the craft specialists above, and the priests and kinsfolk of the ruler higher still. The functions of the ruler are often separated from those of the priest: palace is distinguished from temple. The society is viewed as a territory owned by the ruling lineage and populated by tenants who have an obligation to pay taxes. The central capital houses a bureaucratic administration of officials; one of their principal purposes is to collect revenue (often in the form of taxes and tolls) and distribute it to government, army and craft specialists. Many early states developed complex redistribution systems to support these essential services.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>I. </b>&nbsp;  This rather simple social typology, set out by Elman Service and elaborated by William Sanders and Joseph Marino, can be criticised, and it should not be used unthinkingly. Nevertheless, if we are seeking to talk about early societies, we must use words and hence concepts to do so. Service’s categories provide a good framework to help organise our thoughts.

        <h2><b>The psychology in Happiness</b></h2><br>
      </div>
      <p>

        <b>A. </b>&nbsp;   In the late 1990s, psychologist Martin Seligman of the University of Pennsylvania urged colleagues to observe optimal moods with the same intensity with which they had for so long studied pathologies: we would never learn about the full range of human functions unless we knew as much about mental wellness as we do about mental illness. A new generation of psychologists built up a respectable body of research on positive character traits and happiness-boosting practices. At the same time, developments in neuroscience provided new clues to what makes us happy and what that looks like in the brain. Self-appointed experts took advantage of the trend with guarantees to eliminate worry, stress, dejection and even boredom. This happiness movement has provoked a great deal of opposition among psychologists who observe that the preoccupation with happiness has come at the cost of sadness, an important feeling that people have tried to banish from their emotional repertoire. Allan Horwitz of Rutgers laments that young people who are naturally weepy after breakups are often urged to medicate themselves instead of working through their sadness. Wake Forest University’s Eric Wilson fumes that the obsession with happiness amounts to a “craven disregard” for the melancholic perspective that has given rise to the greatest works of art. “The happy man” he writes, “is a hollow man.”
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>B. </b>&nbsp;  After all people are remarkably adaptable. Following a variable period of adjustment, we bounce back to our previous level of happiness, no matter what happens to us. (There are some scientifically proven exceptions, notably suffering the unexpected loss of a job or the loss of a spouse. Both events tend to permanently knock people back a step.) Our adaptability works in two directions. Because we are so adaptable, points out Professor Sonja Lyubomirsky of the University of California, we quickly get used to many of the accomplishments we strive for in life, such as landing the big job or getting married. Soon after we reach a milestone, we start to feel that something is missing. We begin coveting another worldly possession or eyeing a social advancement. But such an approach keeps us tethered to a treadmill where happiness is always just out of reach, one toy or one step away. It’s possible to get off the treadmill entirely by focusing on activities that are dynamic surprising, and attention- absorbing, and thus less likely to bore us than, say, acquiring shiny new toys.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>C. </b>&nbsp;   Moreover, happiness is not a reward for escaping pain. Russ Harris, the author of The Happiness Trap, calls popular conceptions of happiness dangerous because they set people up for a “struggle against reality”. They don’t acknowledge that real life is full of disappointments, loss, and inconveniences. “If you’re going to live a rich and meaningful life,” Harris says, “you’re going to feel a full range of emotions.” Action toward goals other than happiness makes people happy. It is not crossing the finish line that is most rewarding, it is anticipating achieving the goal. University of Wisconsin neuroscientist Richard Davidson has found that working hard toward a goal, and making progress to the point of expecting a goal to be realized, not only activates positive feelings but also suppresses negative emotions such as fear and depression.

        <b>D. </b>&nbsp;   We are constantly making decisions, ranging from what clothes to put on, to whom we should marry, not to mention all those flavors of ice cream. We base many of our decisions on whether we think a particular preference will increase our well-being. Intuitively, we seem convinced that the more choices we have, the better off we will ultimately be. But our world of unlimited opportunity imprisons us more than it makes us happy. In what Swarthmore psychologist Barry Schwartz calls “the paradox of choice,” facing many possibilities leaves us stressed out – and less satisfied with whatever we do decide. Having too many choices keeps us wondering about all the opportunities missed.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>E. </b>&nbsp;   Besides, not everyone can put on a happy face. Barbara Held, a professor of psychology at Bowdoin College, rails against “the tyranny of the positive attitude”. “Looking on the bright side isn’t possible for some people and is even counterproductive” she insists. “When you put pressure on people to cope in a way that doesn’t fit them, it not only doesn’t work, it makes them feel like a failure on top of already feeling bad.” The one-size-fits-all approach to managing emotional life is misguided, agrees Professor Julie Norem, author of The Positive Power of Negative Thinking. In her research, she has shown that the defensive pessimism that anxious people feel can be harnessed to help them get things done, which in turn makes them happier. A naturally pessimistic architect, for example, can set low expectations for an upcoming presentation and review all of the bad outcomes that she’s imagining, so that she can prepare carefully and increase her chances of success.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>F. </b>&nbsp;   By contrast, an individual who is not living according to their values, will not be happy, no matter how much they achieve. Some people, however, are not sure what their values are. In that case Harris has a great question: “Imagine I could wave a magic wand to ensure that you would have the approval and admiration of everyone on the planet, forever. What, in that case, would you choose to do with your life?” Once this has been answered honestly, you can start taking steps toward your ideal vision of yourself. The actual answer is unimportant, as long as you’re living consciously. The state of happiness is not really a state at all. It’s an ongoing personal experiment.

        <h2><b>Bio-mimetic Design</b></h2><br>
      </div>
      <p>

        <i>What has fins like a whale, skin like a lizard, and eyes like a moth? The future of engineering. Andrew Parker, an evolutionary biologist, knelt in the baking red sand of the Australian outback just south of Alice Springs and eased the right hind leg of a thorny devil into a dish of water.</i>
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>A. </b>&nbsp;   “Its back is completely drenched!” Sure enough, after 30 seconds, water from the dish had picked up the lizard’s leg and was glistening all over its prickly hide. In a few seconds more the water reached its mouth, and the lizard began to smack its jaws with evident satisfaction. It was, in essence, drinking through its foot. Given more time, the thorny devil can perform this same conjuring trick on a patch of damp sand – a vital competitive advantage in the desert. Parker had come here to discover precisely how it does this, not from purely biological interest, but with a concrete purpose in mind: to make a thorny-devil-inspired device that will help people collect lifesaving water in the desert. “The water’s spreading out incredibly fast!” he said, as drops from his eyedropper fell onto the lizard’s back and vanished, like magic. “Its skin is far more hydrophobic than I thought. There may well be hidden capillaries, channeling the water into the mouth.”
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>B. </b>&nbsp;    Parker’s work is only a small part of an increasingly vigorous, global biomimetics movement. Engineers in Bath, England, and West Chester, Pennsylvania, are pondering the bumps on the leading edges of humpback whale flukes to learn how to make airplane wings for more agile flight. In Berlin, Germany, the fingerlike primary feathers of raptors are inspiring engineers to develop wings that change shape aloft to reduce drag and increase fuel efficiency. Architects in Zimbabwe are studying how termites regulate temperature, humidity, and airflow in their mounds in order to build more comfortable buildings, while Japanese medical researchers are reducing the pain of an injection by using hypodermic needles edged with tiny serrations, like those on a mosquito’s proboscis, minimizing nerve stimulation.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>C. </b>&nbsp;  Ronald Fearing, a professor of electrical engineering at the University of California, Berkeley, has taken on one of the biggest challenges of all: to create a miniature robotic fly that is swift, small, and maneuverable enough for use in surveillance or search-and-rescue operations. Fearing made his own, one of which he held up with tweezers for me to see, a gossamer wand some 11 millimeters long and not much thicker than a cat’s whisker. Fearing has been forced to manufacture many of the other minute components of his fly in the same way, using a micromachining laser and a rapid prototyping system that allows him to design his minuscule parts in a computer, automatically cut and cure them overnight, and assemble them by hand the next day under a microscope.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>D. </b>&nbsp;  With the micro laser he cuts the fly’s wings out of a two-micron polyester sheet so delicate that it crumples if you breathe on it and must be reinforced with carbon-fiber spars. The wings on his current model flap at 275 times per second – faster than the insect’s own wings – and make the blowfly’s signature buzz. “Carbon fiber outperforms fly chitin,” he said, with a trace of self-satisfaction. He pointed out a protective plastic box on the lab bench, which contained the fly-bot itself, a delicate, origami-like framework of black carbon-fiber struts and hairlike wires that, not surprisingly, looks nothing like a real fly. A month later it achieved liftoff in a controlled flight on a boom.Fearing expects the fly-bot to hover in two or three years, and eventually to bank and dive with flylike virtuosity.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>E. </b>&nbsp;   Stanford University roboticist Mark Cutkosky designed a gecko-insured climber that he christened Stickybot. In reality, gecko feet aren’t sticky – they’re dry and smooth to the touch – and owe their remarkable adhesion to some two billion spatula-tipped filaments per square centimeter on their toe pads, each filament only a hundred nanometers thick. These filaments are so small, in fact, that they interact at the molecular level with the surface on which the gecko walks, tapping into the low-level van der Waals forces generated by molecules’ fleeting positive and negative charges, which pull any two adjacent objects together. To make the toe pads for Stickybot, Cutkosky and doctoral student Sangbae Kim, the robot’s lead designer, produced a urethane fabric with tiny bristles that end in 30-micrometer points. Though not as flexible or adherent as the gecko itself, they hold the 500-gram robot on a vertical surface.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>F. </b>&nbsp;   Cutkosky endowed his robot with seven-segmented toes that drag and release just like the lizard’s, and a gecko-like stride that snugs it to the wall. He also crafted Stickybot’s legs and feet with a process he calls shape deposition manufacturing (SDM), which combines a range of metals, polymers, and fabrics to create the same smooth gradation from stiff to flexible that is present in the lizard’s limbs and absent in most man-made materials. SDM also allows him to embed actuators, sensors, and other specialized structures that make Stickybot climb better. Then he noticed in a paper on gecko anatomy that the lizard had branching tendons to distribute its weight evenly across the entire surface of its toes. Eureka.”When I saw that, I thought, wow, that’s great!” He subsequently embedded a branching polyester cloth “tendon” in his robot’s limbs to distribute its load in the same way.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>G. </b>&nbsp;   Stickybot now walks up vertical surfaces of glass, plastic, and glazed ceramic tile, though it will be some time before it can keep up with a gecko. For the moment it can walk only on smooth surfaces, at a mere four centimeters per second, a fraction of the speed of its biological role model. The dry adhesive on Stickybot‘s toes isn’t self-cleaning like the lizard’s either, so it rapidly clogs with dirt. “There are a lot of things about the gecko that we simply had to ignore,” Cutkosky says. Still, a number of real-world applications are in the offing. The Department of Defense’s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), which funds the project, has it in mind for surveillance: an automaton that could slink up a building and perch there for hours or days, monitoring the terrain below. Cutkosky hypothesizes a range of civilian uses. “I’m trying to get robots to go places where they’ve never gone before,” he told me. “I would like to see Stickybot have a real-world function, whether it’s a toy or another application. Sure, it would be great if it eventually has a lifesaving or humanitarian role…”
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>H. </b>&nbsp;   For all the power of the biomimetics paradigm, and the brilliant people who practice it, bio-inspiration has led to surprisingly few mass-produced products and arguably only one household word – Velcro, which was invented in 1948 by Swiss chemist George de Mestral, by copying the way cockleburs clung to his dog’s coat. In addition to Cutkosky‘s lab, five other high-powered research teams are currently trying to mimic gecko adhesion, and so far none has come close to matching the lizard’s strong, directional, self-cleaning grip. Likewise, scientists have yet to meaningfully re-create the abalone nanostructure that accounts for the strength of its shell, and several well-funded biotech companies have gone bankrupt trying to make artificial spider silk.
