              Dear Sir/Madam,<br>
              <br>
              
              I would like some information about the Tertiary Preparation Certificate. If possible I would like to enroll in this course as a part-time student in 1992.<br>
              I left school eight years ago after completing the 1ISC. Since then I have worked as a sales assistant in both Grace Bros and David Jones. From the beginning of this year I have been in charge of the Children's Wear Department in Grace Bros, Lily field. <br>
              However, in order to advance any further in my career into a managerial position, I will need to do some further study, such as a Marketing or Business Course. Because I have not studied for many years, I believe that I should complete the TPC before enrolling in a Business course.<br>
              Could you please send me the information as soon as possible, and tell me the dates for enrolling in the Tertiary Preparation Certificate.
              <br>
              <br>
              Yours faithfully.

However, I really don't know which university to apply to, so could you send me some information about different colleges? Also can you find out what qualifications I need? For instance, as an overseas student, do I have to take an English test?<br>
                I hope you don't mind doing this for me. It is much better to get this information from someone who lives in the country, so I hope to hear from you soon.

              Dear Manager of Student Hostel Services,<br>
              <br>
              I am writing to seek accommodation in the Snowy Mountains for a group of students from Perth.
              <br>
              <br>
              We expect to be in the Snowy Mountains between June 1 and June 12. There are fourteen people in our group, five men, seven women and a married couple. The five men will accept dormitory accommodation, and the women are happy to share rooms, but the married couple would like a double room.
              We hope to keep our expenses as low as possible.
              <br>
              <br>
              Please tell me about recreational services in the area. The group will bring their own boots for bushwalking, but we are hoping to hire equipment for other sports, like skiing. Some of our group will want to hire geological picks and other equipment, if possible. We also need to know about access to caves and other interesting geological features in the area.
              <br>
              <br>
              I am looking forward to receiving information about the Student Hostel Services and other facilities.
              <br>

              Dear Sir or Madam
              <br>
              <br>
              Re: faulty jumper and refund refusal
              <br>
              <br>
              On Wednesday 2nd January, I bought a green long-sleeved jumper from your store. The jumper was medium-sized and made fom cotton. It cost $59.95 and it was not on special.
              <br>
              <br>
              When I got home, I discovered that there was a small hole in the left sleeve. It looks like a rip of some kind and the stitching has unravelled. I returned to your shop the next day to ask for an identical replacement jumper. Unfortunately there were none in stock. Therefore I asked for a refund. However, the shop assintant refused to give me a refund because it was not the policy of the store.
              <br>
              <br>
              I am writing to demand a refund or, at the very least, a replacement jumper. The jumper is unwearable as it is and I do not want to buy anything else. I hope that you can assist me in this matter. If I do not get satisfaction, I will be forced to seek legal advice.
              <br>
              <br>
              Yours sincerely
              <br>

              Dear Sir,
              <br>
              <br>
              I am writing in reply to a letter I received from you a few days ago. In your letter you state that I am $240 overdrawn and that you will be charging me $70.
              <br>
              <br>
              I would like to point out that the reason I am overdrawn is because of a mistake made by your bank. If you look through your records you will see that I wrote several weeks ago explaining the situation. For the last twelve months, I have been paying $300 a month for a car I bought last summer. The monthly payments were taken directly from my bank account. However, two months ago I sold the car and I wrote to you instructing you to stop paying the monthly instalments. I received a letter from you acknowledging my request, but, for some reason, nothing was done about it. Another $300 instalment has been paid this month and this is the reason why I am overdrawn.
              <br>
              <br>
              I would like you to contact the garage where I bought the car explaining your error. I would also like you to ask them to return the money.
              <br>
              <br>
              Yours faithfully,

              Dear Sir or Madam,
              <br>
              <br>
              I am writing this letter to explain why I have been unable to return the three books have out on three-day loan, which are now overdue.<br>
              After taking the books out on 16th March, I had an urgent phone call from my elderly aunt's neighbour to say that my aunt had had a fall and had been taken into hospital. I am her only surviving relative in this country, so I felt I had to go and see her immediately. I travelled down to Surrey the following morning, thinking I would stay for only two or three days.<br>
              Unfortunately, my aunt's condition has only improved very slowly, so I have had to stay here longer than expected. However, the hospital says that if all goes well, she should be able to go home in two or three days' time, in which case I will be back at the beginning of next week.
              <br>
              <br>
              Dealing in mind the circumstances I trust you will kindly waive any fines that may have accumulated.
              <br>
              <br>
              Yours sincerely

              Dear Sirs,
              <br>
              <br>
              I was one of the passengers who took the flight from Narita (Tokyo) to Heathrow (London) on 5 August. Unfortunately, my suitcase did not come out after the flight. Although I have explained this Mr. McDonald who was in charge at the Luggage Claim Office I have not heard from him as of now.
              <br>
              <br>
              My suit case is grey Samsonite whose size is 10 x 95 cm. There are 3 steckers on one side and 1 heart shaped stecker on the other side. My initials "AR" are also written on both sides.
              <br>
              <br>
              There are a few books and a copy of my thesis in that suitcase which I need for the conference on 19 August.
              <br>
              <br>
              So I would deeply appreciate it if you could give me a prompt reply at your most convenient. My flight number, luggage claim number and address are written below.
              <br>
              <br>
              Flight No : NH 101

              Dear Ms Barnes,
              <br>
              <br>
              I am writing concerning the position of Assistant Office Manager that I am due to begin next Monday. However, a problem has arisen.
              <br>
              <br>
              As you know, I currently work for my uncle’s food-packing business, and you will remember from my interview that I have gained valuable experience there.<br>
              Unfortunately, he has had to go into hospital for an operation, leaving my aunt in charge of both the home and the business. She has asked me, as this is a particularly
              busy time of year, to stay on and help her with the running of the office.
              <br>
              <br>
              I realise this will be inconvenient to you, but very much hope that, given the circumstances, you would be prepared to allow me to take up my position with you two
              weeks later than planned.
              <br>
              <br>
              I would like to emphasise that I remain very keen to work with you, and that I will be gaining further useful experience during this time.
              <br>
              <br>
              I look forward to hearing from you.

              Dear Sir/Madam,
              <br>
              <br>
              I am writing with regard to the article in your newspaper dated 7th September. My house is situated within 20 minutes walk of the airport. Please allow me to point out the problems which have caused serious damage on the residential area. I am fully sure that the problems must be aggravated if the plan is carried out to expand the airport and Increase the number of flights.
              <br>
              <br>
              First of all, the low-flying aeroplanes are utterly distractive. They make such a big noise that I cannot concentrate on housework at all. What is worse, I am woken up by the late hour flights at midnight; I was diagnosed as Insomnia the other day. I should call this situation noise pollution.
              <br>
              <br>
              Secondly, I am afraid that the expansion of the airport may reduce the plot of land for the playground which is under construction near the airport at the moment. To sum up, I strongly disagree with the plan. I would appreciate if you could possibly write the article about the problems and disagreement as I said above.
              <br>
              <br>
              Yours faithfully

              <br>
              I hope you are all well. The flight home seemed very long but my family all came to meet me at the airpoint, which was fantastic. Thank you so much for having me - I enjoy my time with you very much.
              <br>

              I have a favour to ask. When I got home, I realised that I had left a small black handbag in my bedroom. You may recall that I bought myself a new bag while I was in Sydney and I'm pretty sure I put the old one under the bed.
              <br>
              <br>
              I don't really need the bag but some of the things inside are of sentimental value and I would be very grateful if you could send them to me. There is a red address book, a small leather wallet with some photos and a silver necklace. None of the other things are important so please don't worry about them. Could you please let me know how much the postage is and I will send you the money to cover the cost.
              <br>
              <br>
              Looking forward to hearing from you soon. Thank you once again for your help.

              Dear Sir,
              <br>
              <br>
              I am writing in connection with a bag that I left on one of your planes. Last week on Tuesday 4th May I came to London on flight ABC from New York. My seat number was R5. The plane arrived late at night and I was tired. As a result when I got home, I remembered that I had left my bag on the plane under the seat in front of me.
              <br>
              <br>
              My bag is small and made of black leather with a zip opening the top. Inside the bag there is a pen, a paperback I was reading, some car keys and my diary.<br>
              Therefore would your lost property department please check and see if they have my bag and contact me as soon as possible to let me know whether they have found it or not?<br>
              You can contact me on my mobile telephone number which is: 01753 853 736.<br>
              Thanking you in advance for your help, I look forward to hearing from you soon.

              Respected Sir,
              <br>
              <br>
              I have just recently been awarded a place at your esteemed college and I now write with respect to my accommodation requirements for my first initial year.
              <br>
              <br>
              As I will not know anyone at the College, I would like to spend my first year in a Hall of Residence so that I can meet people in this place. I would prefer the Hall to be a single sex female only hall and with full board so that I won't have to worry about cooking for myself. In addition I also require a vegetarian choice as I am vegetarian. If there are no halls offering the above then I would be satisfied in a hall with kitchens so I can cook. In addition I would not like to share my room and I would prefer en suite facilities if you have halls offering this.
              <br>
              <br>
              Thanking you for your assistance in advance, I look forward to hearing from you soon.
              <br>
              <br>

              Dear Sir,
              <br>
              <br>
              Last week on Saturday night some friends and I had dinner in your restaurant to celebrate my birthday. I am writing to thank you for the great evening that we had.
              <br>
              <br>
              All my friends remarked afterwards on the standard of the food and service that we received. All the food was very tasty and well presented. Our waiter, whose name was James, was fast and friendly and put with well with our bad jokes! The restaurant itself was warm and friendly and the atmosphere showed that all the diners there were enjoying their evening.
              <br>
              <br>
              I would like though to suggest one improvement. One of my friends is a vegetarian and he felt that the choice for vegetarians was little small. If you could develop that, it would be a great advantage to your restaurant.
              <br>
              <br>
              Once again I would like to thank you for my highly enjoyable birthday dinner.
              <br>
              <br>
              Yours faithfully,

          <p>
              Last week I borrowed an English grammar book, "English Grammar Exercises" from your library to help me improve my knowledge of English. It was extremely useful, so when I went to visit a friend I took the book with me to show her how good it was.
              <br>
              <br>
              Unfortunately, when I was on the bus going home, I fell asleep and missed my bus stop. I woke up at the next stop and rushed forward to the driver to ask him to stop but forgot to bring the book. As a result, the book was left on the bus. When I rang the bus company the next day, they could not find it and suggested that somebody must have picked it up.
              <br>
              <br>
              Could you please let me know what I have to do now? As I am an international student I do not have very much money, but of course I will pay for a new copy of the book if this is necessary.
              <br>

              <br>
              I have just arrived from overseas and need to have some furniture for my unfurnished flat. A friend has told me that you have some cheap second-hand furniture for sale.
              <br>
              <br>
              Perhaps you can help me. I would like a kitchen table, some chairs, a double bed, as well as a single bed for a visitor, a cupboard for our clothes, and a bookcase. If you sell home appliances, I would like a microwave oven, a fridge, TV set and a CD player too. These must all be clean and the electrical items must be in good working condition with a guarantee of at least three months.
              <br>
              <br>
              I would be grateful if you could give me some prices for these items. If you do not supply electrical goods, can you recommend another shop which does? Also, could you let me know what you would charge to deliver goods to High Street.
              <br>
              <br>
              Thank you for your help. I look forward to hearing from you.
              <br>

              Thank you for asking me to babysit for you. As you know I enjoy looking after Anthony and would be happy to help you out. However, this weekend I have a commitment which I cannot break.

They are getting older so I like to spend as much time with them as possible. Also, it is my father's birthday and I want to celebrate with them. I am really sorry that I am not able to help this time, but I am free next weekend and I would be glad to babysit for you then, if you should choose to go out for the evening.
              <br>
              <br>
              My charge is fifteen dollars per hour until midnight and twenty dollars per hour after that. You would need to give me any special instructions you might have and, of course, leave a phone number in case of emergency.

              Dear Sir,
              <br>
              <br>
              I have been a part-time fitness instructor in your gym for four months. I was pleased to be offered the job, not only because I need to earn some extra money to cover my living expenses but also because I need some experiense in fitness training.
              <br>
              <br>
              It has been obvious to me that people often need help in using the gym equipment.However, it seems that the other trainers have not been encourage to offer assistance to club members. I offer as much as I can, but this means that I am constantly in demand and therefore, working harder than anyone else in the gym. This situation seems rather unfair.
              <br>
              <br>
              While I realise that members receive initial gym instruction, I feel that they also need ongoing help with the equipment. Could I suggest that a letter is sent to trainers promoting this? After all, personal attention of this kind makes people feel valued and may result in increased membership.
              <br>

              Dear Sam,
              <br>
              <br>
              I have just returned from my holidays in France and while we were there we climbed a mountain called 'Parleman' in the French Alps. We were able to drive half way up the mountain but then the road stopped. So we parked, put on our walking boots and began the long uphill struggle.
              <br>
              <br>
              Despite of the road at the begining, it still took us a while to complete the climb but it was well worth the effort. When we got to the top of the mountain, the view was incredible. I could see right across the town and the lake to one side, and on the other side were the snow-covered peaks of Mont Blanc. It was simply breathtaking.
              <br>
              <br>
              As you know, we often go to France on our holidays and next time we plan a trip, I'd really like to take you there. I'm sure you would love the scenery and as you enjoy exercise, you would be able to take advantage of all the mountain walks.
              <br>
              <br>
              I hope to hear from you soon.

              Dear Anna and Leo,
              <br>
              <br>
              We were shocked to hear from Lara about the storm that hit your city recently and the damage done to your house. How awful to come home from your holiday to find the roof blown off the house!
              <br>
              <br>
              I understand how you must feel, as we had a similar experience a few years ago when there was a sudden electrical storm here in Sydney. I came home from work to find that a tree had fallen on top of the house and all the windows were broken. Fortunately the insurance covered the cost of the repairs, but it was still very upsetting.
              <br>
              <br>
              I suppose you have to think positively in situations like this and look at the opportunity you have to improve your house - give it a new look. If we can do anything for you in the holidays, we'd be happy to help.
              <br>
              <br>
              Drop us a line and let us know.
              <br>
              <br>
              Best wishes  
          </p>
