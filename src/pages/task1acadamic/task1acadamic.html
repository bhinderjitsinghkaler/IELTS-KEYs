                The graph shows the estimated maximum population of elephants in a range of Asian countries in both 1997 and 2004.
                <br>
                <br>
                In most of the countries included in the graph, the population fell. This was most noticeable in Malaysia and Thailand, where the number of elephants was thought to be less than half the figure in 1997. In the former, the number of elephants dropped as low as 1000. India remained the country with by far the largest elephant population, but experienced a dramatic fall in numbers so that in 2004 there may have been as few as 7500. Despite its size, China had a very small population of at most 500 elephants by 2004.
                <br>
                <br>
                Although the trend was downwards overall, elephant populations were thought to have remained stable in Laos and Vietnam at approximately 1200. The only country where elephants showed signs of recovering was Cambodia, where numbers may have risen by up to 200.

              The process by which bricks are manufactured for the building industry can be outlined in seven consecutive steps.
              <br>
              <br>
              First the raw material, clay, which was just below the surface of soil in certain clay-rich areas has to be dug up by a digger.
              <br>
              <br>
              Then the lumps of clay are placed on a metal grid in order to break up the big chunks of clay into much smaller areas, which fall through the metal grid onto a roller, whose motion further segregates the bits of clay. Sand and water are added to make a homogenous mixture, which is then either formed in molds or cut into brick-shaped pieces by means of a wire cutter.
              <br>
              <br>
              Those fresh bricks are then kept in a drying oven for at least 24 and a maximum of 48 hours, several dozen if not hundreds of bricks at a time. The dried bricks are then transferred to a so-called kiln, another type of high temperature oven. First they are kept at a moderate temperature of 200C – 1300C. This process is followed by cooling down the finished bricks for 48 to 72 hours in a cooling chamber.
              <br>
              <br>
              Once the bricks have cooled down and have become hard, they get packaged and delivered to their final destination, be it a building site or storage.

              The graph gives past, present and future data concerning the production of world’s oil on OPEC and non-OPEC countries. The figures indicate that while the production of oil in Middle Eastern OPEC countries is predicted to increase considerably, oil production elsewhere is likely to fall.
              <br>
              <br>
              Between 1980 and 2000, most of the world’s oil came from non-OPEC countries; only two million barrels per day were produced by OPEC countries. Since then, these figures have changed considerably. Between 2000 and 2010 it is predicted that approximately 10 million barrels will come from Middle Eastern OPEC countries, while a further 10 million barrels will be provided by other OPEC or non-OPEC countries.
              <br>
              <br>
              Although forecasters predict that oil production is likely to stabilise between 2010 and 2020, a lot more of this oil is expected to come from the Middle Eastern OPEC countries, and under 5 million barrels per day from other areas.

              The bar graphs demonstrates the number of marriage and divorce in 9 different nations for the years 1981 and 1994. As can be seen from the chart, with the exception of Denmark the rate of marriage in all of these countries diminished over the surveyed period while that of divorce  experienced an increase in five out of nine nations.
              <br>
              <br> 
              As is presented in the bar chart, the marriage rate in 1981 in the USA was by far the highest among the reported nine nations which was more than 10 per thousand. In other European countries, including United Kingdom, France, Finland, Denmark, Italy, the marriage rate was around 6 for each thousand. Denmark had the lowest rate of marriage in 1981 which was about 5/thousand. After 15 years the marriage rate fell slightly in a majority of the given nations with the exception of Denmark with the rate rising by nearly 2/thousand.
              <br>
              <br> 
              It is noticeable from the divorce statistic that the highest rate of divorce rate was in the USA which was over 5 per thousand. The divorce rate in 1994 went on in comparison with that  in 1981 in all of the nations apart from USA and Denmark. Italy had the lowest divorce rate among the given nations and there was no change in this rate for the given 2 years in Germany.

              The chart compares population shares in various regions of the world with the distribution of wealth in these same regions. It can be seen that population shares in almost all cases do not relate to the distribution of wealth.
              <br>
              <br>
              Even though North America has only approximately 6% of the world’s population, it boasts nearly 34% of global wealth. A similar situation can be seen in Europe, which has 15% of the global population but 30% of global wealth, and the rich  Asia-Pacific countries with 5% of the world’s population but 24% of its wealth.
              <br>
              <br>
              On the other hand, the total wealth of people in China, India, Africa, Latin America and Caribbean, and the other poor countries in Asia-Pacific is far less than their shares of the world population. This is most striking in India, where 16% of the world’s population own only 1% of the world’s wealth and in China, which has the highest percentage of global population (24%) but only 3% of the world’s wealth.
              <br>
              <br>
              Overall, the world population statistics are inverse in proportion to wealth distribution. If the former is higher, then the latter is likely to be lower.

              The table gives information on the market share of mobile phone manufactures for two consecutive years, 2005 and 2006.
              <br>
              <br>
              In both years, Nokia was clearly the market leader, selling 32.5% of all mobile phones in 2005, and slightly more (35%) in 2006. This is a greater market share than its two closest competitors, Motorola and Samsung, added together.
              <br>
              <br>
              Motorola increased its market share from 17.7% in 2005 to 21.1% in 2006. In contrast, Samsung saw its share of the market decline slightly from 12.7% to 11.8%.
              <br>
              <br>
              The other companies listed each had a much smaller share of the market. Sony Ericsson’s share increased from 6.3% in 2005 to 7.4% in 2006 whereas L.G decreased slightly from 6.7% to 6.3%. BenQ Mobile’s share more than halved from 2005 to 2006; from 4.9% of the market to only 2.4%.
              <br>
              <br>
              Other mobile phone manufactures accounted for 19.2% of the market in 2005- more than all the companies mentioned except Nokia. However, in 2006 the other companies only made 16.2% of mobile phone sales- less than both Nokia and Motorola.

              The table shows details for four countries concerning the percentage of the population who use the railways, how many kilometres each person travels on average, and the number of tons of cargo the railways carry.
              <br>
              <br>
              What is surprising is that very few Americans use rail- less than half of one per cent- and they do not travel far (just 80 kilometres). However, the Canada carries by far the most cargo, nearly 3 thousand billion tons. This contrasts greatly with China, where 27% of the population use rail, and they each travel further (1980 kilometres) than any of the other countries. On the other hand, less than 25 billion tons of freight is carried.
              <br>
              <br>
              The two countries which are most similar are the Malaysia and UAE. Both have between 5 and 6% of people who use trains, they travel between 770 and 780 kilometres and the amount of freight is approximately the same (22.2 and 21.9 billion tons respectively).
              <br>
              <br>
              In general it can be seen that while citizens of the Canada use rail transport the least, they transport the most amount of cargo by rail.

              The flow chart shows what typically occurs as a consequence of deforestation. When trees are removed, there are four main immediate effects, which eventually result in flooding, degraded vegetation and a loss of biodiversity.
              <br>
              <br>
              One immediate effect is soil which has been compacted by heavy equipment. The result hard, ‘baked’ soil contributes to the run off of rain water and, eventually, flooding.
              <br>
              <br>
              Another immediate consequence of logging is a reduction in the number of roots holding the soil together. This leads to soil erosion. As a consequence, the quality and variety of vegetation is compromised.
              <br>
              <br>
              The third immediate effect is burning, both deliberate and a consequence of an increased risk of forest fires. The waste that remains after loggings is destroyed and the microorganisms that feed on this material are lost. This leads to degraded vegetation.
              <br>
              <br>
              The final immediate consequence is a reduction in the amount of moisture plants return to the air. Because there is less moisture in the air, there is less precipitation and an increased incidence of drought. This too reduces plant growth and ultimately results in degraded vegetation and a loss of biodiversity.

              The diagram shows how fresh applet is canned. First the apple is picked from trees by hand. It is then transported to the cannery by large trucks. At the cannery the apple is washed and quality checked, and any poor quality apple is rejected.
              <br>
              <br>
              The good quality apple is put into cold storage. When it is ready for canning the apple is weighted and graded. The grading ensures that the apple of a similar size is kept together. After this the apple is peeled and the cores are removed. It is then sliced into the required sizes and put into cans. Juice or syrup is also added to the cans.
              <br>
              <br>
              Once the cans have been filled they are sealed and cooked over heat to ensure that the cans are sterilized. When the cans are cool, a label is attached and they are placed into storage. The canned apple is now ready to be despatched to supermarkets and sold.

              The pie charts compare home ownership and renting for 1991 and 2007 in percentage terms. In 1991, home owner were the most popular type of housing, accounting for 60%, or more than over half of all homes. The next largest sector was social rented homes, amounting to 23% or nearly one-third of homes. The remaining homes were mostly privately rented (11%) with a tiny fraction being social housing (6%).
              <br>
              <br>
              Sixteen years later, in 2007, the number of home owners had risen to 70%, or almost three quarters of all homes. This was an increase of 10% compared with 1991. Much of the increase in home ownership can be explained by the decrease in social rented homes, which had dropped from 23% to 17%.
              <br>
              <br>
              The percentage of privately rented homes had remained unchanged at 11%. However, there were 5 million more homes in 2007 compared with 1991 so the number of rented homes had increased despite the same percentage. Social housing has decreased three-fold from 6% in 1991 to 2% in 2007, and it remains the least popular type of housing.

              The bar chart shows information about people’s drinking behavior by age group in the US. Several trends are evident.
              <br>
              <br>
              The highest proportion of those who never drink (nearly two-thirds) was in the 16 to 24 years group. The proportion tended to decrease with age. Only 40 per cent of people aged 65 to 74 had never drink.
              <br>
              <br>
              On the other hand, the percentage of those who had quit drinking tended to increase with age. Only 5 per cent of those in the youngest age group (16 to 24) were ex-drinkers, as opposed to roughly 40 per cent of those aged 65 to 75.
              <br>
              <br>
              The percentage of those classed as heavy drinkers also showed a distinct pattern. People in middle age (35 to 54) tended to be the heaviest drinkers – approximately 13 per cent of the total. A relatively small proportion of those in the youngest age group, and an even smaller percentage of those in the oldest group (roughly 3 per cent) drink heavily.
              <br>
              <br>
              Overall, age appears to be a significant factor in patterns of drinking behavior.

              The bar chart shows the gender distribution of students doing computer scientific research across a range of disciplines at a US university in 2011.
              <br>
              <br>
              In five of the six disciplines, males outnumbered females. Male students made up a particularly large proportion of the student group in subjects related to the study of programming objects: mathematics, programming, and engineering. The gender gap was particularly large in the field of mathematics, where there were five times as many male students as female students.
              <br>
              <br>
              Men and women were more equally represented in subjects related to the study of computer science: natural sciences, psychology, and linguistics. In natural science, there were nearly as many women [approximately 200] as men [approximately 240]. This was also true of psychology. Linguistics was the only discipline in which women outnumbered men [roughly 110 women vs. 90 men].
              <br>
              <br>
              Overall, the chart shows that at this university, computer science subjects continue to be male-dominated; however, women have a significant presence in fields related to psychology and the computer sciences.

              The graphs illustrate the consumption of 4 types of food used in the word in 2008. The figures are compared to the amounts of food used in china and India in the same year.
              <br>
              <br>
              As an overall trend, the two countries showed different food consumption from the world average, while processed food consumption still had the largest percentages in all the three charts.
              <br>
              <br>
              In particular, processed food consumption was the highest in the in the world, accounting for 41%, which was followed by vegetables and fruits at 29% and animal food at a quarter. Only 4% consisted of nut and seeds consumption.
              <br>
              <br>
              Likewise, China used processed food in the largest proportion of 39%. Animal food showed the same figure as the world’s average, 25%. Vegetable and fruits was used at 23% while nuts and seeds showed less than a half figure.
              <br>
              <br>
              In India, both vegetable and processed food were used the most in the year 2008 with percentages of 34% and 32% respectively, nuts and seeds used in this country showed the largest proportion among the three charts given, making up 19% at this time.

              <br>
              As an overall trend, increased amounts of money spent on cars, computers and eating out were made up for by drops in expenditure on food and books.
              <br>
              <br>
              In detail, food and car made up the two biggest item of expenditure in both years. Together they comprised over half of household spending in the UK. Food accounted for 44% of spending in 1971, but this dropped by two thirds to 14% in 2001. However, the outlay on cars doubled, rising from 22% in 1971 to 43% in 2001.
              <br>
              <br>
              Other areas changed significantly. Spending on eating out doubled, climbing from 7% to 14%. The proportion of salary spent on computers increased dramatically, up from 2% in 1971 to 12% in 2001. However, as computer expenditure rose, the percentage of outlay on books plunged from 6% to 1%.

              <br>
              Once the high school has been obtained, students need to complete an application for university entrance. This can be downloaded from the university website. The completed application should then be sent to the administration.
              <br>
              <br>
              Applicants receive a reply two weeks later which is provisional acceptance, a rejection or an acceptance. If a rejection is received, students can either cancel their application altogether or complete an application for an alternative course and send to the administration office.
              <br>
              <br>
              A provisional acceptance means that more documentation is required. Applicants in this situation should complete the additional documentation and submit them to the office. When an acceptance is received, the applicant should complete the enrolment form and select which subjects he or she wishes to undertake and register with the dean. When all this is complete, the applicant may enter university.

              When it comes to people with no children, single people made up a large percentage of 24%, which is almost the same figure for single people with children. On the other hand, only 9% of the couples without any children suffered from poverty in 2002. In terms of aged people, singles had a slightly higher percentage than couples. Only 7% and 5% of the aged population had hardships in their living circumstances.

              <br>
              <br>
              In general, railway systems in different cities vary in terms of the start dates of each system, the sizes, and the numbers of passengers using the systems in a year.
              <br>
              <br>
              As far as the ages are concerned, Paris has the oldest railway system among the six cities. It was opened in the year 1863, which is incomparable to the other cities. On the other hand, Berlin has the newest railway system which was opened in Europe 2001.
              <br>
              <br>
              In terms of the sizes, Paris, for certain, has the longest route, 394km, which is nearly twice the figure for Stockholm. Madrid, in contrast, has the shortest route in its railway system, only 28km.
              <br>
              <br>
              When it comes to the numbers of people using the railway system in each, Lisbon shows the largest number of 1927 million passengers in a year while Madrid serves the smallest number of railway users, 45 millions.

              Two graphs give different information related to eight professional groups. The bar chart indicates the number of weekly work hours done by the groups while the pie graph illustrates the percentages of people suffering from stress related illness in the different professions given.

              <br>
              In general, business men work the longest among the eight groups while the smallest amount of time is normally worked by lecturers. According to the pie chart, lecturers struggle the most with work-related stress. Although their average working hours is smaller than any other group in the chart, lecturers suffer from the highest level of stress caused by their job.
              <br>
              <br>
              The bar graph shows that business men and movie producers work the most at about 70 hours and 62 hours per week respectively. At the opposite end of the scale, lecturers work only around 25 hours. Working hours of other professionals varied with doctors, writers, programmers, lawyers and chefs working approximately 52, 46, 35 and 32 hours per week in the name ordered.

              The chart illustrates average distance travelled by various modes of transport in Netherland in 2001 and 2006. The figures are given in miles and to show how people’s preference changed over time.
              <br>
              <br>
              In general, people in Netherland travelled more in the year 2006 than in 2001. Cars showed unparalleled figures among the given categories. Except walking, using bicycles and taking local buses, most of the categories showed overall increases in the distance travelled.
              <br>
              <br>
              In detail, a person driving his own car travelled 3,199 miles on average in 2001, and the average distance showed a moderate rise to 4,806 miles in 2006. Apart from cars, taking trains, using long distance buses and taxis also experienced an overall growth in their figures from 289 miles to 366, from 54 miles to 124, and from 13 miles to 42 respectively in the order named.
              <br>
              <br>
              On the other hand, walking and rising bicycles were not more favored by Dutch people. Both categories showed a moderate decline in their figures. Meanwhile, the number of people who used local buses must have dropped significantly as the average distance experienced a dramatic fall from 429 miles in 2001 to 274 miles in 2006.
