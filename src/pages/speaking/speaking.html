                As I am interested in photography, I have taken thousands of photos. However, the most meaningful photograph to me is the big one of my family. The picture is hung on the wall of my living room and it is the first thing that everyone notices since the moment they walk into my house.  
                <br>
                <br>
                The photograph was taken one year ago on an occasion of summer holiday. It was the first time that my family enjoyed the summer vacation together. We decided to go on a trip to Sam Son beach which is one of the most popular destinations for summer holiday in my country. 
                <br>
                <br>
                The photo was probably the first picture of my whole family with my parents, my older brother, my little sister and me. It is such a brilliant photo, with every one standing on the beach and smiling. The one behind the camera was a professional photographer who has a great eye for photography. You can even see the crystal clear water sparkling under the sunlight and the seashore in the background. It was a scorching hot day, and the sky was blue with no clouds, making it a perfect scene to take a photo.
                <br>
                <br>
                The photo is very special to me. Whenever I feel unhappy, just looking at the picture cheers me up right away. I believe that no matter what happens, my parents and my siblings will always stand by me and support me.

            As a high school student, I learned a number of subjects. Among them, I was not really into history at the first time. The reason was really simple: I disliked the teaching method of my teacher. It was boring, and I will tell you why.
            <br>
            <br>
            He was a lazy teacher, I thought. He just copied words, facts and figures from the book to the board and made us to write down what he wrote. Then he told us to memorize all information if we did not want to receive a low score for this subject. This made me and my classmates sick. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Later when I grew older, I had a chance to watch a movie about Vietnamese history. The movie is about King Ly Cong Uan relocating the capital city from Ninh Binh to Hanoi more than a thousand years ago. I really liked the film and realized that history is not as boring as I thought. After that I managed to read more historical articles and watched more historical movies, and now I am really interested in history.
            <br>
            <br>
            I think the Ministry of Education should adjust the school curriculum or train teachers how to deliver history lessons more successfully and attractively. Without any action, many Vietnamese pupils still hold a negative attitude towards history.

          I’m going to talk about a friend of mine. His name is Peter. Although he’s very young – only a year ahead of me, Peter is a co-founder of our school’s English Club.
          <br>
          <br>
          Actually, English is not my major at university but all of the students are required to take IELTS test as part of the graduation requirements. So I decided to join the English Club and that’s how I met him. My first impression of this friend was that he had a good command of English and, also, he demonstrated a great passion for this language. He helped me practice making conversations in English for a while before we became close friends.
          <br>
          <br>
          The thing that most people, including myself, find attractive about Peter is that he has such a great sense of humor. I mean, he can make anyone laugh even when they don’t feel like to. He has a way of making people feel cheerful and comfortable when they are around him.
          <br>
          <br>
          I definitely think Peter is a competent leader because he knows exactly how to connect with people in his network and motivate them to achieve common goals. He’s incredibly creative as well. Taking part in his English Club is many students’ favorite activity. He has such a positive influence on people, which I think is what it takes to become a pioneer.

          We all have a never-ending wish list of things that we want to buy, so do I. One item that has been on my wish list for a long time is a one-bedroom apartment of my own.
          <br>
          <br>
           I hope to cross this item off my list by the time I turn 30. I know it sounds impossible but it’d be cool if I could do it. And the most important thing is that I have a longterm goal to pursue. Since I am an independent person, I have always wanted to move out of my parents’ house. As soon as I graduated college, I wanted to buy a small apartment. where you would like to buy it *: I’m currently looking for a condo a little further away from the city centre. Despite the fact that it will take longer for me to travel to work, the price will be more reasonable and I will be able to afford it. and
           <br>
           <br>
          Having a flat of my own means a lot to me for several reasons. Firstly, I can decorate the house according to my own tastes and personality. Secondly, I can do whatever I want without interfering in my parents’ lives. I can invite my friends over for the weekend and I can throw a party anytime I want. Most importantly, I want to show my parents that I am a grown-up woman and that I can take good care of myself.

          I would like to share with you my impressions of a garden that I visited last summer, which was full of colour and interest: Claude Monet‟s house and garden in Giverny, France.
          As a big fan of Monet‟s paintings, especially the famous „Water Lilies‟, I had always dreamed of seeing he scene in real life. So, when some friends suggested a visit last year, I jumped at the chance. After a journey of about an hour by train from our hotel, we arrived at Giverny. The garden was exactly as he had painted it – it was a riot of colour, from the peaceful white of the water lilies to the striking reds and oranges which filled some of the flowerbeds. The two parts of the garden complemented each other perfectly. We first admired the array of bright flowers and fruit trees in the Clos Normand, but my favourite part was the water garden, and we enjoyed a leisurely stroll, taking in all the colours, perfumes and bird songs. Monet avidly collected prints of Japanese gardens, and these inspired the Japanese bridges covered with wisterias, the water lilies in the pond, and the bamboo and weeping willows which he planted.
          For me, it was like a wonderland of colours and a dream come true after so many years.

          Well, speaking of the course I’d like to do, I would say that it’s an English course. Today, English is considered to be the most important language in the world. That’s why it became one of the compulsory subjects and we now have to study English from elementary onwards.
          <br>
          <br>
          I’d like to get admitted to the Foreign Trade University which offers a professional course in Business English. They have a good reputation for teaching this course effectively to a high standard. As I have other classes in the morning, I would like to enroll in the afternoon course. Also, the course fee is both cheap and convenient for me to pay using my bank account.
          There are so many reasons why I’d like to enroll in an English course. First of all, English is an international language, hence, having a knowledge of English can help people around the world to communicate better. Second, it also gives us countless opportunities to become more acquainted with other cultures. We depend on English to keep up to date with the latest news from all over the world, since almost all the books and magazines are written in this language. Finally, learning English can really help us in our careers and enhance our CVs, as these days, many firms need good office employees to conduct international business.

          One of my ambitions that I have not yet achieved is to be able to communicate in Japanese.
          <br>
          <br>
          I just thought about this idea a year ago because I realized that nowadays, knowing more foreign languages is an advantage not only in our daily lives but also in work environments.
          <br>
          <br>
          In order to achieve this, I registered for a Japanese class for beginners, twice a week. I also downloaded an application on my iPhone which helps people study foreign languages named Duolingo, so that I can study on my own at home. For the first two months, I did not skip any classes, and spent at least 30 minutes every night studying Japanese on Duolingo at home.
          <br>
          <br>
          Unfortunately, I could not keep up with the schedule for long since I was working full time, not to mention that I had many other social activities that distracted me from studying. There were days when I was so busy that I had to work overtime to finish my job. As a result, I wasn’t able to go to class and I definitely didn’t have any time to study at home. Moreover, my friends complained that I had been ignoring them, so I needed to arrange time to hang out with them. Just like that, I gradually lost my ambition to study Japanese and until now, I can only remember one alphabet table, even though Japanese uses three types of alphabets.

          One of my best friends has a 3-year-old baby girl; so every time we went out, she would take her with us.
          <br>
          <br>
          Her little girl is such a witty kid, and she is always full of energy. As she begins to be aware of the outside world, she asks a lot of questions just to satisfy her curiosity.
          <br>
          <br>
          It happened one day when we went out shopping. While her mother and I took turns trying clothes on, she was sitting quietly on the bench. Then she looked at me and her mother and started to express her opinions on our clothes.
          <br>
          <br>
          The way she talked was so funny that we couldnt stop laughing. She was so used to playing with her Barbie doll that she suggested we should dress like one of her dolls.
          <br>
          <br>
          She even taught us how to walk like models because she thought that was pretty.
          <br>
          <br>
          All the customers who walked in the store noticed her, even the store owner couldn‟t stop laughing at her since she was still a baby girl, but she talked and acted like a grown-up
          <br>
          <br>
          That was probably the best part of the shopping trip that I will never forget.

          Since I was very small, I have had a special interest in cooking. So, it is no surprise that, now that I have grown up, I dream of having an oven with rings for cooking on top, which is in very popular use overseas. In my country, this kind of oven is only sold at big electronic and appliance centers.
          Different from the normal oven, this one provides more stable and exact temperatures, which is one of the critical factors in baking. Besides, it has four oven top elements, which is highly convenient because it allows you to cook and bake at the same time. It also saves a lot of space in your kitchen because it is free-standing. Another feature that I would like the oven to have is a self-cleaning system. If you cook frequently, you will definitely appreciate this facility. It is inevitable that when you cook, your oven/cooker will get dirty. As a result, with the self-cleaning feature, it is much easier for us to clean.

          It goes without saying that future is quite uncertain and almost no one can predict exactly what is waiting for them ahead, however, to some extent I always believe that our future depends on our plans and actions at present. As a fresh graduate, I want to become an entrepreneur and run a chain of boutique shops selling stylish clothing, dresses and jewelry. This is probably because ever since I was a kid, I have had a great passion for designing and sewing pieces of garments, firstly for my doll and then for real people around me. Gradually, I constantly get more insights into fashion industry and keep me posted with clothes that are in the thing. Although I am currently majoring in economics instead of fashion designing, I hold a strong belief that my acute business sense and a sincere interest in the clothing business will help me to succeed in the future. Nevertheless, I always have to remind me that opening and running an apparel store is serious business and that I have to put one hundred percent effort in leading it to success as well as get ready to face up to failures. I guess that’s why some people around me wonder why I want to give up the safety of my corporate job with good compensation package such as steady income, insurance, pension plan, long vacations and the opportunity for rapid promotion just to become a small business owner. The answer is indeed quite simple for me, which is I want to walk out of my comfort zone, challenge myself in a new business and last but not least, give myself a chance to fulfil my childhood dream.

          In this hectic life, it is easy for people to get stressed out from different situations. Therefore, we all need a place of rest and relaxation where we can temporarily get away from the hustle and bustle of the daily life. Everyone needs a place to hide away. For me, that is the kitchen. I choose blue and white for kitchen’s wall because those colors help me to unwind. On top of that, I enjoy every single moment spent in the kitchen. When I cook in the kitchen, I find myself in another world where I am able to mix all ingredients together to try out a brand new recipe. Therefore, there are many baking stuff and machines arranged nicely in my kitchen. After cooking, I usually invite some of my close to come over and throw a party to enjoy my home-made cakes and dishes; but every now and then, I just cook for my family. My mother and father always give some generous compliments on my cooking skills and keep telling me that cooking is my inborn talent, which makes me jump for joy. That’s why I always love to be in the kitchen. It also becomes a very social place where everyone in the house gathers together to have a small chit-chat about our daily life. Therefore, kitchen, for me, represents a place of spiritual meaning. I believe that the warm from kitchen will warm up the house and the moments we spend in the kitchen can help strengthen the family bonds.

          The most special meal I’ve ever had in my life was on my Dad’s birthday last year, which was prepared by all of my family members.
          <br>
          <br>
          The idea was put forward by my sister. We planned to surprise him and prepare his favorite foods. On that day, my Mom cooked Pho, a Vietnamese beef noodles, while I baked a birthday cake for him. My siblings were in charge of decoration and music. Everything had been done properly a little bit earlier before he came home. When he opened the door, he was astonished because of seeing a colorful “Happy birthday Daddy” banner sticked on the wall in the living room. Standing in front, my mom gave him a bouquet of red roses, his favorite flowers. We enjoyed the scrumptious meal and shared our best memories with my Dad.
          <br>
          <br>
          After washing dishes, we gathered together in the living room. My Dad made a wish and blew candles. He said in tears that he was over the moon and he was proud of us, his home and his family. We gave each other great hugs before going to sleep.

          Well, fat belly is always of the top concerns of all women in this whole world, and I am not of an exception. So, for the last 3 years, when my belly becomes fatter and fatter, I would like to take some physical exercises to get toned and make my body into good shape, looking for a prospect of getting a slim body, which would definitely make others green with envy.
          <br>

          I’ve planned to achieve this objective carefully. I asked my friends, who are in physical training courses, for advice on which kind of exercises I should take. I carried out some research, too. Then, I found out that I should practice squat, and sit-up. I installed an app in my mobile phone, which helped me keep track of my practice and give me some certain advice provided by professional trainer.
          <br>
          <br>
          Unfortunately, I couldn’t persist in this practice for too long as in the first day, I was so eager that I practice squat too much, which caused muscle’s tension. Thus, I had to rest for some days after, which lowered my motivation. Finally, after those days, I gradually gave up on my practice and my belly continued to grow. Admittedly, it was really a shame to me as I thought I could achieve that goal.

          I remember when I was in secondary school, we had a sewing class. Our teacher asked us to make a pillowcase. Because I had never made any sewing things before, I thought it would be extremely tough to me. However, after asking for some advice from my grandmother, and with her help, of course, the task turned out to be not as hard as I expected. Actually, it was just a piece of cake to me.
          <br>
          <br>
          As we had to make a small size, I decided to make a sofa pillowcase, which was square-shaped. Then I went out to buy materials like cloth, zipper, clew, needle, scissors and some decorative items. After that, I cut the cloth into three pieces as I had to put zipper on and began to sew under my grandmother’s instruction and finished it within 30 minutes. I made the case’s rim, and decorated the case by embroidering flowers and leaves on it. As it was the very first time I did such things, I drew flowers and leaves on the pillowcase first, then embroidered based on them with basic skills.
          <br>
          <br>
          I managed to make a beautiful pillowcase after 3 hours, with the help from my grandma. Taking a look at my achievements, I was so happy and proud of myself. My teacher was extremely pleased with the thing I made, too.

          If there is something I want to learn more, it would be belly dance which is originated from India, and, also, an excellent method of keeping fit and getting toned. I have learnt it before when I was a teenager. At that time, I was so hectic with my study that I didn’t have enough time for this class. Now that I have finished my study, I am of temptation to learn more about it in the future.
          <br>
          <br>
          There is a belly dance class taught by my neighbor, just 500 meters from my house. Thus, it is very convenient for me to go there. This class is not very big or famous but it’s warm, cozy with a lot of friendly people, which can motivate me to practice this kind of dance. The facilities are not expensive but always in good condition, and the teacher is warm-hearted, qualified and experienced. When she was young, she was very popular for her excellent belly dance performance. After having babies, she decided to alter the job to teaching at home. I haven’t gone to class for a long time, but she still remember me, and often smile to me everytime I pass by the class.
          <br>
          <br>
          Belly dance is not only an art of body movements but also an effective way to improve my balance and flexibility. As I grow older, I am fully aware that keeping fit is very important. Moreover, belly dance, with magnificent costume, and beautiful music can help me relax after a long working day. For those above reasons, I am really looking forward to being able to learn it more down the road.

          I would like to share with you one of the most interesting conversations I had with my teacher about my university choice.
          <br>
          <br>
          To be honest, at that time, I was so confused with a lot of choices that I was totally exhausted. It was a tough decision for me because university was a turning point for my future career prospect. If I chose wrong, I would waste a lot of time and efforts. The hardest part, I think, was to balance between my possibility to be admitted and the suitability between my potentials and the field of the university. I had chosen a famous and high-ranked university, but I wondered whether I was qualified enough to register for it.
          <br>
          <br>
          As it was the first time I had to make such big decision, I came to my dear teacher to ask for some advice as she had a lot of experience in every field. After listening carefully to my explanation, she asked me why I chose that university. I told her that because I was impressive with their teaching methods and extracurricular activities. Besides, as their students were highly qualified, I thought I can build up a good network there and learn a lot from them. Then, she asked what made me afraid of this choice, I answered that’s I wondered if I were excellent enough to be admitted. She smiled when I said so, and calmed me down by saying that I were among the most outstanding students she had had, and she was extremely confident that I could manage to meet their requirements. However, she implied that I shouldn’t worry too much about failure, instead, I should make a concerted effort to reach the goal I set, thus, in the end, though the consequence was good or bad, there would be no regrets. Her words really made me inspired that it could released all my fears and worries.
          <br>
          <br>
          This conversation was interesting to me because apart from positive advice, she also helped to calm me down, thus, made me focus more on studying to achieve my goals. Then, I got a satisfied results for my application and had a wonderful university life. Until now, I still feel thankful to her for that interesting conversation.

          My family often go on vacation every summer. Last year, we went to Ha Long Bay, which is located in Vietnam. As it is among Seven Wonders of the World, the beach was so impressive to me.
          <br>
          <br>
          My family and I took a 12-hour plane journey through different time zones, which made me get really bad jet lag; therefore, I didn’t enjoy the first day much. However, to be honest, I have to admit that the scenery there was so beautiful and appealing to me, especially the beach. The beach, after a makeover, was extremely breathtaking, and the crystal clear water seemed to stretch endlessly till the horizon. To make it even more attractive, the waves continued to crash onto the shore, sounding like a romantic melody from nature. Though I was a little tired, I was so excited that I just wanted to jump into the water right away.
          <br>
          <br>
          While some people enjoyed swimming, there were a lot of people who preferred sunbathing or playing volleyball, team-building games or making sandcastles. My family, after swimming a lot in scorching hot weather, chose to come back to the hotel to change clothes before heading for some good seafood restaurants.
          <br>
          <br>
          Actually, this vacation gave me a wonderful chance to have some days off, and all my worries seemed to fade away. Furthermore, it helped strengthen the bond between my family members. That’s why I am always looking forward to going on more holidays like this every year.

          I have to deal with overwhelming workload recently. However, if I have any spare time, I would like to sit down with a book and a cup of tea. Books always keep me calm and relaxed. Until now, I have read numerous books, but the one which has the greatest influence on me until now is The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho.
          <br>
          <br>          
          Alchemist was first published in 1988, but it is not until 2015 that I read this book. At that time, I had read “Little Prince”, and fallen head over heels in love with it. Then all of a sudden, I stumbled upon a review about Alchemist written that “It is like Little Prince for Asian”, which made me so curious about it and hunger for reading it. I decided to buy this book straight away. After spending a whole day reading the book, The Alchemist became my favorite book, surpassing “Little Prince”.
          <br>
          <br>          
          Although the book is not as thick as other famous novels like “Gone with the wind” and the like, it still succeeds in inspiring a devoted following around the world. This story is about an Andalusian shepherd boy named Santiago who travels from his homeland in Spain to Egyptian desert in search of a buried treasure in the Pyramids. On the way he reach the destination, there are a number of obstacles that he has to overcome, and some people that give him a lot of lessons about life.
          <br>
          <br>          
          Though this kind of journey can be told in many other books, Alchemist, dazzling in its powerful simplicity and inspiring wisdom can give me an unique outlook on life. This story has successfully taught me about the importance of passion in every life. To pursue your passion, you should try as hard as possible.

          Well there is one app in my smart phone that I take advantage of it on a daily basis. It called Health Mate built to help people track sporting and fitness activities. I got this app 5 months ago, and actually was recommended by my intimate friend who used it first. After a long day of hard work, I will do a series of physical exercises with my phone and the app will track all my progress and save my result.
          <br>
          <br>
          Since I have this app, I can gain weight loss and enjoy a better health. In addition, what makes the app so useful is that not only it has physical exercises for me, but it also is a source of motivation and inspiration for me to insist. You know, doing workouts everyday is quite tedious, and the app will remind me to continue my plan at the appropriate time. Besides, all my results will be shared in social network, which will attract my friends to encourage me, too. By dint of it, I can enhance physical and mental health and can be always in a good mood to come up with great ideas when I study at school.
          <br>
          <br>
          This app requires a lot of practical functions and especially I can have a golden chance to socialize with more partners who want to enjoy a better life like me.

          Being a girl living in my 20s, I strongly believe that I should choose a right path for my career. In my opinion, a good career is not only a job that can offer me a good income to afford my living, but is enjoyable as well. That’s why I think a job in Marketing field will suit me well.
          <br>
          <br>
          I had spent a great amount of time on defining my strengths and weaknesses as well as asking for advice from other people. After that, I came to a conclusion that my outstanding skill is writing which I have an inborn talent for. Since I was at the age of 8, I was found out to be gifted in Literature by my teachers. They contributed a lot to developing my set of skills. During years of study majoring in literature, I was often considered to be among the best students. Along with my writing skills, I think I will utilize my analytic skills and creativity which I acquired after years of studying at my university to dig into customer’s behaviors, then, develop a good campaign to get more customers for our company.
          <br>
          <br>
          Additionally, I am strongly passionate about Marketing. Therefore, I began to work in this field quite early, since I was a freshman. Those working experience provide me basic knowledge and skills of Marketing as well as strengthen my belief that this job would suit me.
          <br>
          <br>
          Even though I have gained a lot of experience and knowledge of Marketing and I am currently working in Marketing department of Fast-moving Consumer Good company, I still have a long way to go before knowing it inside out.  I also hope that I can be good enough to get some promotion in near future.

          I have always been a huge fan of music. I love listening to music because good music helps me recharge my battery and energy as well as uplift my spirit after a long day overloaded with work and study. I listen to many different kinds of music from Rock to Jazz, depending on where I am, who I am with and how I feel at the time. Today I’m going to tell you about one of my favorite songs titled ‘Hello’.
          <br>
          <br>
          The genre is pop, as characterized by its upbeat music and simple, down-to-earth lyrics. It’s actually a single that just went platinum this week. The song is incredibly popular at the moment, I mean, it’s the talk of the town. It’s been topping the charts for weeks, and has got millions of streams on music sites.
          <br>
          <br>
          The person who performs the song is Adele, an internationally acclaimed artist, hailing from the UK. She’s made a killing with her albums, but she’s maintained a somewhat low-profile lifestyle. I am a huge fan of her. I have an impressive collection of her records that I really treasure. Maybe I would have the fortune to attend one of her concerts.
          <br>
          <br>
          I first listened to the song last week. It was when I was in the middle of finals. I was up to the ears in revision and it was incredibly nerve-racking time, so I needed something to let my hair down. That’s when I went to YouTube to watch some music videos. The minute I heard Adele’s voice, I was hooked and totally blown away. I’ve put the song on repeat ever since.
          <br>
          <br>
          I am keen on the song for a number of reasons. First, it was her voice that struck me, which is incredibly soothing, and has a nice warm quality to it. The lyrics is also dope. It talks about emotions after two people part ways in a relationship and I can definitely relate to that.

          Lately, I haven’t had much time to go out for a movie since I’ve been up to my eyeballs in reports and presentations. Hence, to relax and boost my mood, I rented some good old movies and made myself some healthy snacks for late night treat. “Silver Linings Playbook” is one of my all-time favorites and I’ve lost count how many times I replayed it.
          <br>
          <br>
          The last time I watched it was a week ago on Saturday night. Oscar nominated movies were usually not my taste due to their complexity and lack of entertainment but Silver Linings Playbook was an exception. I’ve always preferred something a little sentimental, light-hearted, yet meaningful and this movie had it all. Silver Linings Playbook was an adaptation from the novel written by Matthew Quick, starring two incredibly talented actors Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence. This romantic comedy movie was about two wounded souls who once again found beauty in the most unexpected place. Pat (Bradley), a former teacher, was just released from a mental institution and trying to reconcile with his cheated wife despite his family’s protest. He met Tiffany (Jennifer), a woman with problems of her own, and things got complicated. Two people bearing hidden scars with no hope in the future finally had lights in their lives again. The movie was not heavy at all but extremely entertaining with some laugh-out-loud moments. No matter how many times I’ve watched it, I still got emotional every time I replayed it.  The underlying message was also a shout-out to anyone who believe they have hit rock bottom: “When one door closes, another door opens”. Therefore, keep moving forward and don’t lose hope. If anyone run out of movies to watch, I highly recommend “Silver Linings Playbook” as a change of appetite.

          I would like to talk about a piece of work that I had to do quickly, which was the preparation for a two-minute talk in the IELTS Speaking test, the one that I am taking at the moment.
          <br>
          <br>
          I just finished this preparation a few seconds ago. When the second part of the Speaking test began, I was given a topic which required me to describe something I had done quickly. Personally I think that was a really difficult topic, and it was even more challenging since I had only one minute to prepare for the talk. I had to think really fast. The first thing I needed to do was to choose a piece of work to talk about, and this was the hardest part. At first I thought about a university project that I had to finish in five days, but then I wasn’t sure whether five days is considered “quick” enough for this topic. And then an idea came to my mind. Why not talk about the very difficult work I was doing at that moment, which was to think of an appropriate topic? Then I quickly decided to choose it and made a plan for a talk about it. I had to do everything quickly because I was given only one minute for the preparation. So, I needed to think very fast and to write down all the ideas very quickly. In my opinion, preparing for a talk in just one minute is really challenging, and it’s partly because I had to think in English, which isn’t my first language. Luckily I managed to finish the preparation on time, and I finally had enough ideas to talk about this topic.
          <br>
          <br>
          The result of this, um, I don’t know yet because I will have to wait 13 days to see the result of this Speaking test. However, I think I have already done everything I could, and let’s hope that I will get a satisfying result.

          Honestly, I had to admit that I am quite a down-to-earth person and barely either spend time imagining or day dreaming. However, every now and then in school life, imagination is life saver in remembering the knowledge imparted, especially in the subject of History. Indeed, envisaging a chain of images and actions inside my head based on the story or series of events in the book enabled me to acquire new things way more efficiently. For instance, in the time of learning about the history of chocolate, by utilizing the technique of imagine and envisage the image, just like making a movie inside my head, I could remember quickly a quite enormous knowledge and can still recall today. I can tell you that wild chocolate trees can grow easily in the humid Amazon rainforest. Clusters of flowers from these trees turn to seeds. Approximately 20 to 60 cacao beans, which are the ingredient needed to create sweet, soothing and delicious chocolate treats, can be found in the seeds. The Mayan and Aztec cultures both thought that chocolate trees are brought from paradise by God. They used the bean from this divine tree to create a special beverage with a very pleasant odor. Gradually, the treats and drinks made of these beans become prominent and millions of people around the world adore it as the most delicious sweet ever. Making my own film using the imagination in fact helps me to obtain knowledge like a piece of cake.

          In my to-meet list, there are so many well – respected celebrities whom I am desired to meet and spend time with. However, I would like to share about Pele, who is nicknamed as the greatest soccer player around the Globe.
          <br>
          <br>
          Initially, I really need to kick off with the point that Pele was just seventeen when he first played in World Cup in Sweden of 1958 for Brazil. Despite his very young age, he was selected for the national team participating one of the biggest sport competition on the planet. Back then, he was not the star player but when his teammate was hurt, Pele went into the game. He immediately scored goal and Brazil won the World Cup. By his amazing aptitudes and skills, Pele was feared by other teams. The Brazilian government even named him as a national treasure. It is not doubtful to say that Pele is one of the biggest factors making Brazil’s soccer so well – known. His last World Cup was in Mexico in 1970. Brazil scored 4 goals against Italy to win the World Cup for the third time. Another point that I would like to share is that Pele owns an admirable career that every soccer players crave for. Pele holds many soccer records such as having over 1000 goals in his career. He was nominated athlete of the Century in 1980 and became a member of a soccer Hall of Fame in 1993.
          <br>
          <br>
          Although he’s now retired from professional competition, Pele is still considered as a great inspiration for soccer players and lovers.

          I’d like to talk about Zalora group, one of the leading companies  specializing in selling clothes.
          <br>
          <br>
          It is an e-commerce company  for online shopping purposes and provides a wide variety of style as well as current fashion trend for both men and women . The company has been through so many ups and downs that there was a time when they were on the edge of bankruptcy. At first, I didn’t care much about it ,not until I came across a eye-catching dress when going shopping in the mega mall did I become interested in its products.  What amazed me is that the price is much cheaper than other brands so I can get the best offer without asking for a bargain. Normally it would take me 3 days for the merchandise to be delivered but just only 2 days  I could receive it. Another thing is that the refund policy of zalora is much better than Lazada which is its competitor. Customers can return unpleasing products within 10 days and get a brand new one with similar price so that’s the reason why zalora has great customer base than any competitors. Lately, the company has expanded its chain all over the place, therefore, customers no longer have to wait for delivered products and can enjoy great service from physical stores.
          <br>
          <br>
          Starting from modest investment to  a leading company that has highly profitable and  thousands of employees, zalora is an icon for lots of start-ups and youngsters  running their own businesses.

          I’m not a great swimmer in any sense but swimming is like my religion. It is truly refreshing and literally, washes away every disturbing thought I have whenever I dive into cold water. No matter how tight my schedule may get, I usually pay at least one visit to a local swimming pool to work myself up and get rejuvenated.
          <br>
          <br>
          Sometimes, I have a partner or two, who have been my best friends since high school. We live in the same neighborhood so it’s not too stressful when we have to set a schedule for our swimming session. We carpool more often than not and it takes us roughly 15 minutes to get to the local recreation center where it provides the locals with a variety of facilities for training purpose such as gym class, stadium, swimming pool, tennis court and so on, which is extremely convenient for those who practice more than one activity. The only thing better then swimming itself is swimming with your besties, which is one of hundreds of things I love about my weekly ritual. Hardly do we have time to meet each other during week days as we’re all up to our neck at work and totally stressed out. Therefore, having such a healthy way to catch up with my friends and recharge battery after an exhausting week never sounds better. Just like any other sports, swimming helps maintain your health, keep you fit as well as build your endurance. However, unlike others, it’s a very relaxing and peaceful form of exercise, you don’t even sweat for hours – a supreme advantage. Therefore, if you’re looking for a kind of sport that brings you comfort and relaxation, swimming should be your first choice.

          There is a thing that troubles me more often than not when living in is the majority of people are riding motorbikes rather than cars. As a result, most people don’t know how to drive a car, I included, which also itches me since I have always wanted to take a road trip across the country. A road trip by car from the south to the north of my country would be tough and adventurous because hundreds of marvelous destinations are awaiting to be explored. However, it is worth taking risks and stepping out of your comfort zone to truly experience what life has to offer when your legs can still carry you rather than to regret in your later life.
          <br>

          “If you wanna go fast, go alone. If you wanna go far, go together.” It might be fun if you were a lone traveler and didn’t enjoy getting lagged behind your schedule. Still, the adventure could be more colorful and unexpected, hopefully in a good way, when you got company, especially during a long journey like the one I prefer. Hence, picking up a close friend or two who share the same vision, the same eagerness to capture the beauty of nature would be my choice. We would start from the south where we are living and move north on the go, stopping at our favorite beaches a little longer than other places because there ain’t nobody don’t have time for juicy coconuts and white sand paradise. Traditional cuisine would also be our utmost priority whenever we reach a new place as the best way to live like a local is to eat like a local. A car is our best choice because it would give us room to comfortably converse with each other and shelter from inclement weather during our journey, if any. It is not only about the destinations but also about the time I would love to spend with my dear friends as we would share the same space in a four-wheel vehicle along the road; and at the end of the day, it’s the people that matters.

          Learning a second language not only adds up your skills but also offers enormous benefits for your brain and personal growth. Additionally, being bilingual or multilingual expands your knowledge across the country’s border and provides you easy access to the understanding of other cultures. Therefore, beside English, Spanish sits high in my must-learn list due to its wide application and beautiful culture.
          <br>
          <br>
          Needless to say, Spanish is one of the most spoken languages in the world and one of the six official languages used in United Nations conferences and statements. Spanish is spoken in most countries in South and Central America and in the US, over 50 million people are using Spanish either as their mother tongue or second language. As a result, knowing Spanish would absolutely widen your horizon, develop your sense of appreciation for Hispanic culture as well as transform your travel experience as who knows when you would bump into some Spanish friends on your adventure. Many have said that Spanish is one of the easiest languages to learn thanks to its phonetic pronunciation and its similarity with English, in terms of vocabulary. However, it’s easier said than done. No matter how simple and intriguing that may sound, without full commitment and self-discipline, being able to speak Spanish would be a far-fetched idea. Therefore, in order to meet my goal and not to get demotivated along the way, I would have to find a learning partner and we would fight this tough war together.
